    "detailsSection": "The Microsoft Windows 2003, XP Professional and XP Embedded Security Target, defines the requirements for Version 3.0 of the Windows Server 2003 with SP2 and XP Professional with SP2 Common Criteria Evaluation and is henceforth referred to as the Windows 2003/XP V3 ST.  The Windows 2003/XP V3 ST provides a set of security requirements taken from the Common Criteria (CC) for Information Technology Security Evaluation.  The Window Server 2003 products were evaluated against the Windows 2003/XP V3 ST and found to satisfy the security target requirements. <br />\n<br />\nThis document is targeted at those responsible for ensuring that the installation and configuration process results in a secure configuration.  For the purposes of this document, a secure configuration, henceforth referred to as the Evaluated Configuration, is one that enforces the requirements presented in the Windows 2003/XP V3 ST. <br />\n<br />\nNote: The required configuration settings specified by this document are used explicitly to achieve the Evaluated Configuration.  Microsoft also produces the <b>Windows Server 2003 Security Guide</b> ( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=14845 ) and the <b>Threats and Countermeasures: Security Settings in Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP Guide</b> ( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=15159 ), which can be used to determine the <br />\nrecommended settings that an organization might want to apply.  Most of the recommended settings defined in this document were derived from a review of the Windows Server 2003 Security Guide and the Threats and Countermeasures: Security Settings in Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP document, along with other material identified in the References chapter of this document.",
