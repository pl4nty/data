An important part of maintenance is the retiring or decommissioning of existing components that you replace with different or newer components. \r\nThere are two main sections in the \u201cUninstalling Lync Server 2010 and Removing Server Roles\u201d documentation. The first section, \"Removing Servers and Server Roles,\" includes the procedures you need to perform to remove specific servers or server roles. For example, removing an A/V Conferencing pool or a Front End pool. The second section, \"Decommissioning a Deployment,\" provides step-by-step guidance for removing a complete Lync Server 2010 deployment. For example, removing a deployment from a test lab as part of a move to a Production system, or as part of a redesign of the current Lync Server 2010 deployment prior to deploying the new design.\r\n",
