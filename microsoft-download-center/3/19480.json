The SOA programming model allows solution developers and architects to rapidly develop new high performance computing cluster-enabled interactive applications and easily modify existing distributed computing applications. With Windows HPC Server 2008, the developer build/debug/deploy experience is streamlined, the speed of processing is accelerated, and the management of the applications and systems is simplified.<br />\n<br />\nThis white paper provides a technical overview of SOA applications and the Windows HPC Server 2008 functions that support the SOA model; including building and deploying SOA applications; their architecture, runtime system, scaling, and performance considerations; and monitoring and troubleshooting.",
