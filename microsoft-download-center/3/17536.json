    "detailsSection": "The new features focus on configuration change management and enhanced troubleshooting designed to help you identify and resolve ISA Server configuration issues within the ISA Server Management console. <br />\n<br />\nThe service pack includes the following new features and feature improvements:<br />\n<br />\n   \u2022 Configuration Change Tracking\u2014Registers all configuration changes applied to ISA Server to help you assess issues that may occur as a result of these changes. <br />\n   \u2022 Test Button\u2014Tests the consistency of a Web publishing rule between the published server and ISA Server.<br />\n   \u2022 Traffic Simulator\u2014Simulates network traffic in accordance with specified request parameters, such as an internal user and the Web server, providing information about firewall policy rules evaluated for the request.<br />\n   \u2022 Diagnostic Logging Viewer\u2014Now integrated as a tab into the ISA Server Management console, this feature displays detailed events on packet progress and provides information about handling and rule matching.<br />\nImprovements for existing features, including:<br />\n   \u2022 Support for integrated NLB mode in all three modes, including unicast, multicast, and multicast with Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP). Previously, ISA Server integrated NLB-supported unicast mode only.<br />\n   \u2022 Support for use of server certificates containing multiple Subject Alternative Name (SAN) entries. Previously, ISA Server was able to use either only either the subject name (common name) of a server certificate, or the first entry in the SAN list.<br />\n    \u2022 Support for Kerberos Constrained Delegation (KCD) cross-domain authentication. Credentials from users located in a different domain than the ISA Server, but in the same forest, can now be delegated to an internal published Web site by using KCD .<br />\n    \u2022 Support for client certificate authentication in a workgroup deployment. This removes the requirement to map each client certificate to an Active Directory\u00ae  directory user account when forms-based authentication is used as the primary authentication method and client certificates are used as the secondary method.<br />\n<br />\nFor more information about this service pack, see <A HREF=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943462\">Microsoft Article 943462</A>. <br />\n<br />\nFor general information about installing ISA Server updates and hotfixes, see <A HREF=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=94429\">Microsoft Article 885957</A>.",
