    "detailsSection": "Unified communications (UC) broadly defines a highly integrated\r\ncommunications environment that combines, or unifies, email, voice,\r\nvideo, and data communications in innovative ways to provide process\r\nand productivity improvement. Given that the competitive\r\neffectiveness of global manufacturing firms will be largely dictated by\r\ntheir ability to get the greatest performance out of their business\r\nnetworks, UC technology represents an important enabling technology\r\nplatform. UC represents both immediate business benefit in the form\r\nof reduced travel and telecommunication costs and long-term returns\r\nthrough higher levels of information use, better decision making, and\r\nshortened process cycles.\r\nThis document frames the business environment, discusses the state of\r\nUC technology, and provides examples of highly successful UC\r\nimplementations.",
