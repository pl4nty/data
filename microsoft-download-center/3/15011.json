    "detailsSection": "The <b>Fuzzy Lookup Add-In for Excel</b> was developed by Microsoft Research and performs fuzzy matching of textual data in Microsoft Excel. It can be used to identify fuzzy duplicate rows within a single table or to fuzzy join similar rows between two different tables. The matching is robust to a wide variety of errors including spelling mistakes, abbreviations, synonyms and added/missing data. For instance, it might detect that the rows \u201cMr. Andrew Hill\u201d, \u201cHill, Andrew R.\u201d and \u201cAndy Hill\u201d all refer to the same underlying entity, returning a similarity score along with each match. While the default configuration works well for a wide variety of textual data, such as product names or customer addresses, the matching may also be customized for specific domains or languages.",
