This library provides tremendous flexibility for how titles implement 3D, with support for multipoint emitters and multichannel sound sources, independent listener and emitter objects, and transparent calculations that can be utilized, replaced, or enhanced at will by the title. This talk offers a sampling of X3DAudio functionality, with demonstrations of various techniques for making soundscapes immersive and dynamic.",
