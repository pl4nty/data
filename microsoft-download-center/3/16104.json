Users can ask the IM an Expert service a question and the service will locate an expert and connect the asker with the expert. Answers are compiled from dialog between the asker and the expert and posted to the organization\u2019s internal IM an Expert website, where they can be searched. IM an Expert provides a great way for people within an organization to save time by sharing their knowledge and expertise. Perhaps equally important, the retained IM an Expert questions and answers can provide a valuable knowledge base that highlights common questions and resolutions to issues within your organization.
