It features conceptual and \"How to\" articles, sample code, and programming references for the Project 2010 clients and Project Server 2010.<br /><br />The <b>Project2010SDK.exe</b> download is updated for Project 2010 Service Pack 1 (SP1). The SDK download includes two help files: <b>Project2010SDK.chm</b> (conceptual topics and managed code reference), and <b>Project2010_ReportingDB.chm</b> (the Reporting database schema reference).
