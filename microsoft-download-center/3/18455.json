Scenario Summary: Enterprise financial information is often housed in accounting, customer relationship management (CRM), and other line-of-business systems. The data from these systems is rich and comprehensive, but it is often difficult to use. Regular reports might not have the most current information or address the most critical business questions. A financial dashboard solution built using the Microsoft Office System enables financial decision-makers to retrieve, view, and analyze the data they need from these systems without leaving the familiar Microsoft Office Excel 2003 environment.",
