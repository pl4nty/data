    "detailsSection": "When you bind Windows Forms controls to an ADO.NET data source, specifically with a BindingSource as an intermediary, the searching, sorting, and filtering capabilities built in to a DataView are automatically exposed by the BindingSource. However, when you want to bind to a list of business objects, you have to implement these features yourself. A good solution is a generic implementation that can be reused with various business objects. This article describes how to extend the generic BindingList and implement the filtering functionality of the IBindingListView. This implementation enables you to store custom business objects in a list that you can search, sort, and filter.",
