It describes how system administrators can take advantage of DFS-N during disaster recovery from one StorSimple appliance to another, and maintain the same share names. This provides transparency and continuity to end users during disaster recovery, and removes the need for manual tasks and changes post recovery. This paper also outlines how to use BranchCache to distribute content to remote sites and branches, and includes a reference architecture and best practices for using DFS-N and BranchCache along with StorSimple for large deployments.\r\n\r\n",
