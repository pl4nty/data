It also manages the Office 365 subscriptions for these schools.  As a leading-edge IT operation, CENC was interested in continuing to build out their modern infrastructure to operate all Office 365 scenarios over Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), and agreed to work with Microsoft to implement and test this configuration. \r\n\r\nIn this document we will describe the steps required to configure and test Office 365 to operate entirely over IPv6 and what CENC encountered as they deployed it.
