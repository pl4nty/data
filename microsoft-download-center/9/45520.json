Download and install the version that matches the architecture of the computer on which you plan to install the administration tools. If you are not sure whether your computer is x86- or x64-based, see <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/827218\">How to determine whether a computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system</a>.\r\n<br/><br/>Remote Server Administration Tools for Windows 10 is available in the following languages: cs-CZ, de-DE, en-US, es-ES, fr-FR, hu-HU, it-IT, ja-JP, ko-KR, nl-NL, pl-PL, pt-BR, pt-PT, ru-RU, sv-SE, tr-TR, zh-CN, and zh-TW. If the system UI language of your Windows 10 operating system does not match any of the available RSAT languages, you must first install a Windows 10 Language Pack for a language that is supported by RSAT, and then try installing Remote Server Administration Tools for Windows 10 again.\r\n<br/><br/><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Remove all older versions of Administration Tools Pack or Remote Server Administration Tools\u2014including older prerelease versions, and releases of the tools for different languages or locales\u2014from the computer before you install Remote Server Administration Tools for Windows 10. Only one copy at a time of Remote Server Administration Tools can be installed on a computer. If you have upgraded to Windows 10 from an older release of Windows, you will need to install Remote Server Administration Tools for Windows 10 on the computer; no earlier releases of Remote Server Administration Tools are still installed on a computer that you have upgraded to Windows 10.\r\n<br/><br/>Remote Server Administration Tools for Windows 10 includes support for remote management of computers that are running Windows Server. It can be installed on Windows 10, but it cannot be installed on Windows Server.\r\n<br/><br/>Earlier releases of Remote Server Administration Tools (such as those for Windows 8.1) are not available--nor do they run--on Windows 10.\r\n<br/><br/>Server Manager is included with Remote Server Administration Tools for Windows 10; GUI-based tools that are part of this release of Remote Server Administration Tools can be opened by using commands on the Tools menu of the Server Manager console. To use Server Manager to access and manage remote servers that are running Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2, you must install several updates on the older operating systems. For more information about requirements for using Server Manager to manage remote servers, see <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=241358\">Manage multiple, remote servers with Server Manager</a>.",
