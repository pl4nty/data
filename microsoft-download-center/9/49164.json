    "detailsSection": "If you want to activate volume license editions of Office 2016, Visio 2016, or Project 2016 with a KMS host or Active Directory-Based activation, you need to first install Office 2016 Volume License Pack. When an Office 2016 volume edition client is installed, it will automatically attempt to activate via either Active Directory by using its existing domain pairing or a DNS-discoverable KMS host on your organization network. To set up Active Directory-Based activation, you must be running Windows Server 2012, Windows 8, or newer.\n<br /><br />\nAll volume editions of Office 2016 client products are pre-installed with a Generic Volume License Key (GVLK) key, which supports automatic activation for both KMS and Active Directory-Based Activation, so you will not need to install a product key.\n<br /><br />\nThis download contains an executable file that will extract and install KMS host license files. These license files are required for the KMS host service to recognize Office 2016 KMS host keys. On Windows Server 2012 and volume license editions of Windows 8, you can use your same KMS host key to set up Active Directory-Based activation. \n<br /><br />\n4324.1002 update extends the Key Management Service (KMS) to support co-hosting of Office 2013 and Office 2016 on Windows Server 2008 R2.",
