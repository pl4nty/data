    "detailsSection": "Software Inventory Logging is intended to reduce the operational costs of inventorying the Microsoft software deployed across many servers in an IT environment.  This Software Inventory Logging Aggregator 1.0 will install on one server and receive inventory data from any Windows Server configured to forward data to it via the Software Inventory Logging feature available in Windows Server itself.  The design allows data center administrators to enable Windows Server's Software Inventory Logging feature in master images intended for wide distribution in their environment and deployed with automation.  This software package is the target point and intended for customers to install on their premises for easy logging of inventory data over time.  This software also allows for periodic creation of basic inventory reports in Microsoft Excel.  Software Inventory Logging Aggregator 1.0 reports include counts of installations of Windows Server, System Center, and SQL Server.\r\n<br></br>\r\nImportant: No data is sent to Microsoft with the use of this software\r\n<br></br>\r\nFor more info and details on Software Inventory Logging Aggregator, go to:\r\n<A href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=616388&clcid=0x409\">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=616388&clcid=0x409</A>\r\n\r\n",
