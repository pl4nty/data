The script will create, update or delete mail-enabled public folder objects on O365 Active Directory based on what exists in the local Exchange deployment.\r\n</UL>\r\n<UL>\r\nThe script must be executed from local Exchange Management Shell window providing access to mail public folders in the local Exchange deployment. Then, using the credentials provided the script will create a session against Exchange Online, which will be used to manipulate O365 Active Directory objects remotely.\r\n</UL>\r\n\r\n<UL>NOTE - Before running the script, copy the Sync-MailPublicFolders.strings.psd1 file in the same directory as the Sync-MailPublicFolders.ps1 script file.</UL>",
