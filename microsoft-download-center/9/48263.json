    "detailsSection": "Upgrading to Team Foundation Server 2015 can take a significant amount of time depending on the size of your database. Team Foundation Server has to be offline while the databases are being upgraded. TfsPreUpgrade.exe can be used to do the most expensive parts of the work to upgrade to Team Foundation Server 2015 while your Team Foundation Server 2013 deployment is still online, greatly shortening your offline time. We recommend running this tool for collection databases that exceed 1 TB in size. \r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n11/25/2015 Update: New version of TfsPreUpgrade posted which includes a fix for a performance issue related to pre-upgrading one of the TFS Build tables. Both the original version of TfsPreUpgrade.exe and this version are compatible with Team Foundation Server 2015 RTM and Team Foundation Server 2015 Update 1.",

It will report progress along the way so that you can have some idea of how far along it is and how much time might be left. Once TfsPreUpgrade.exe has completed, the triggers that it installs will keep any additional changes made due to the server being online flowing into the migrated tables. As such, there is no need to run it again before performing your offline upgrade to Team Foundation Server 2015. ",
