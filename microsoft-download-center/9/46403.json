    "detailsSection": "Leading companies rely heavily on software applications to win, serve, and retain customers. But faster delivery of applications is challenging for both infrastructure and operations (i.e., Ops) professionals and application development and delivery (i.e., Dev) teams. Both are under pressure to increase speed without compromising quality. To maximize their efforts, neither team can go it alone \u2014 they must work together to find a common set of processes and tools that help them both. This is the core of the DevOps movement. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nTreating infrastructure as code (IaC) is a key element of DevOps, and it benefits both teams. This Forrester Thought Leadership Paper (TLP) evaluates the hypothesis that IaC is indeed core to DevOps and that adopting IaC principles helps companies of all sizes accelerate software delivery. \r\n",
