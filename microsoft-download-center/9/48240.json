    "detailsSection": "The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) is an anti-vulnerability exploitation toolkit that can be layered onto the Windows OS in addition to other security technologies to raise the bar for exploits to work properly.  It has been increasingly recommended by various IT Security frameworks and governing bodies.  EMET provides additional memory corruption protection for commonly used Internet facing applications.  In the past 2 years EMET has commonly been detailed as a known mitigation for 0-day vulnerabilities that were actively being exploited.\r\n\r\nFor more information about EMET, see http://Microsoft.com/EMET & http://aka.ms/EMET\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Test Lab Guides (TLGs) are a set of documents that step you through the configuration and demonstration of a Microsoft technology or product in a standardized test lab environment, which starts with a common base configuration that mimics a simplified intranet and the Internet. TLGs are designed to be modular, extensible, and stackable to configure complex, multi-product solutions. TLGs make learning about products, technologies, and solutions easier by providing that crucial hands-on, \u201cI built it out myself\u201d experience.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see Test Lab Guides at http://microsoft.com/testlabguides.\r\n",
