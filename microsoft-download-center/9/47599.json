    "detailsSection": "DevOps is a journey that requires previously segregated teams to overcome cultural barriers. Focus on business value and shared solution responsibility transcends individual roles and traditional barriers. The journey is unique to every organization, but there are tenets and practices that are generally consistent. Success in speeding up application development with agile and similar methodologies and processes have, in turn, spurred a \u201cbottom-up\u201d initiative to more tightly align the development teams that build software and the operations teams that run the software.\r\n\r\nThis white paper takes a look at the reasons why DevOps is rapidly going mainstream and Microsoft's set of products that support the underlying desire of DevOps to be more efficient and to become more effective in the software delivery process.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
