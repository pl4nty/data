    "detailsSection": "This volume looks at how you can use different architectures, from Open Business Standards to IT industry architectures, in a connected fashion to support a dynamic enterprise. This Series is about aligning business architecture and IT architecture through dynamic modeling. Making sure business operations are working well across organizational boundaries is a hard challenge. But it is an increasingly important one to address in today's connected world. A key to success in meeting this challenge is making sure the business and IT operations teams within an organization are well connected. A thorough discussion of a real-world business problem \u2013 shipping products from a warehouse to a customer - helps highlight the issues involved in making these connections and meeting this challenge. Particularly, the discussion shows how supporting business operations requirements in the IT organization can play an important role in the solution.",
