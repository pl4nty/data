Graduating to .NET via RPG, QuickBasic, C, C++ and VB his time has been spent in various markets from banking through telecoms and even parts of the record industry. He specialises in .NET and Microsoft Technologies looking at \"whatever takes his fancy\" and running with it to see where it goes, with a passion for sharing the knowledge gathered during each of his code expeditions.
