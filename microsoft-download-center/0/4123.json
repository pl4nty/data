    "detailsSection": "<br/>\r\nMicrosoft\u00ae SSIS Balanced Data Distributor (BDD) is a new SSIS transform. This transform takes a single input and distributes the incoming rows to one or more outputs uniformly via multithreading. The transform takes one pipeline buffer worth of rows at a time and moves it to the next output in a round robin fashion. It\u2019s balanced and synchronous so if one of the downstream transforms or destinations is slower than the others, the rest of the pipeline will stall so this transform works best if all of the outputs have identical transforms and destinations. The intention of BDD is to improve performance via multi-threading. Several characteristics of the scenarios BDD applies to: 1) the destinations would be uniform, or at least be of the same type. 2) the input is faster than the output, for example, reading from flat file to OleDB.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><b>NOTE:</b> &nbsp;An updated version of Microsoft SSIS Balanced Data Distributor (BDD) is available.  This includes a fix for the problem causing BIDS to crash when removing the BDD transform.
