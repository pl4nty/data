You will also review the basics of licensing and learn why Microsoft uses different licensing models for its many products. The Product Terms is a vital legal document and part of your Microsoft Volume Licensing agreement, and we know that it takes time to read and understand the full document. To help you, we have created a licensing story that walks you through examples of how the Microsoft licensing models are applied when using various \u201creal-world\u201d technology solutions. We invite you to follow the director of IT for a midsize company as she finds the best way to license the Microsoft products and services her company needs for a series of IT initiatives.",
