However, there are indications that widespread adoption is only a matter of time as perceived value of these services is high among those who use them.  Key findings: \r\n\r\n\u2022 6 in 10 are aware of LBS, but confusion remains about what LBS are. \r\n\u2022 Among those who use LBS, 94% said they were either very valuable (41%) or somewhat valuable (53%). \r\n\u2022 GPS and weather alerts are most common uses of LBS while only 18% use LBS for sharing their location with others.\r\n\u2022 52% of respondents expressed strong concern with sharing their location with other people or organizations. \r\n\u2022 Of those receiving a location-based advertisement, 46% took action and 80% considered the ads valuable. \r\n",
