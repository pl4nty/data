For example, it is possible to query Analysis Services with similar queries and obtain two different answers. While this appears to be a bug, it actually is due to the fact that Analysis Services caches query results and the imprecision that is associated with approximate data types. This white paper discusses how these issues manifest themselves, why they occur, and best practices to minimize their effect.",
