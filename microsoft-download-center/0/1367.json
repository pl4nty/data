Often this is the only way of ensuring your designs will remain intact and look as intended when the finished project goes live on the web.<br />\n<br />\nWorking on a web based project today generally involves multiple technologies, databases and web servers, all of which need to be installed on your machine if you want to see exactly how your designs will look out in the real world.<br />\n<br />\nWhy waste valuable time installing, configuring, uninstalling and reconfiguring the server environments today\u2019s projects depend on, when a VHD gives you an instant and perfect solution.<br />\n<br />\nA VHD is simply a self contained environment, a virtual machine, with all the software you need already installed, configured and ready for use. Simply run the VHD and you immediately have access to all the software you need to run, build and test your designs in the real live environment and when you\u2019re done, simply close the VHD and the software is gone until you need it again.<br />\n<br />\nUtilizing multiple VHDs preconfigured for different client projects and different configurations gives you maximum flexibility without compromising the stability of your main machine and without repeated and time consuming installs.",
