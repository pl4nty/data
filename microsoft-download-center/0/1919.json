One way to to improve the download time is by running the web setup and selecting only the individual components you need.<BR/>\n<ul><li>For best results, first consult the <b>Readme file </b>available for download \n\tbelow. If you need additional information or asssistance with installing or using the Windows SDK, please vist the <a href=\"http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=121&SiteID=1\">Windows SDK Forum</a> or <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/windowssdk\">the Windows SDK team blog</a>.<br/><br/></li>\n\n\n<li>To download the full <b>ISO image</b> containing bits for all platforms, choose \n<b>6.0.5383.1.1.WindowsSDK_Vista_idw.DVD.Rel.img</b> below. After downloading the IMG file, rename it to .ISO before mounting it.<br/><br/>Due to the large size of the ISO file, we highly recommend you use a download manager tool to manage the ISO download.<br/><br/>\n\tTo install the Windows SDK using the ISO file:<UL>\n\t<LI><b>Accessing the ISO File</b> - An ISO image file is an exact representation of \n\ta DVD, including the content and the logical format. The most common use of \n\tan image file is to write it to a blank DVD-R resulting in an identical copy \n\tof the original DVD including file name and volume label information. ISO \n\tImages can also be extracted directly to a file location by many DVD-R \n\tutilities, including the tool below.</LI>\n\t\t\n\t<LI><b>Mounting ISO files virtually</b> - You can use the\n\t<a href=\"http://download.microsoft.com/download/7/b/6/7b6abd84-7841-4978-96f5-bd58df02efa2/winxpvirtualcdcontrolpanel_21.exe\">Virtual CD-ROM Control Panel for Windows XP</a> \n\ttool to mount the ISO image file virtually as CD-ROM devices without burning \n\tthe image to a DVD. This tool is provided here for your convenience, and is unsupported by Microsoft Customer Services and Support.</LI></UL></li>\n</ul>",
