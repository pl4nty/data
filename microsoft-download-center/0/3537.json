    "detailsSection": "As the foundation for Microsoft Dynamics GP, Windows provides sophisticated standards-based network security.

Because the size of Microsoft Dynamics GP implementations can vary a great deal, it is important to carefully consider the needs of a smaller business and to weigh the effectiveness of security against the costs that may be involved. Use your best judgment to recommend a policy that helps to meet security needs.\n<br />\n<br />\nThis document discusses the following topics: \n<UL><LI>Basic security recommendations</LI>\n<LI>Securing the server operating system</LI>\n<LI>Network security</LI>\n<LI>Virus protection</LI>\n<LI>Microsoft Dynamics GP security</LI>\n<LI>The Microsoft Dynamics GP database security model</LI>\n<LI>Core application security tasks</LI>\n<LI>Frequently asked questions about security in Microsoft Dynamics GP</LI></UL>",
