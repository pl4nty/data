    "detailsSection": "Regulatory compliance is an important issue for most companies in the financial and health care industries. For example, corporate officers in some financial sectors are responsible for the claims made by their employees to their customers. In the context of an enterprise messaging environment where large amounts of information are exchanged on a daily basis, supervising data is a complex but required task. However, e-mail is only one type of data that is regulated and is, therefore, one data source that a full-compliance solution has to manage. Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 Service Pack 1 (SP1) (and Exchange 2000 Server SP3, with the envelope journaling software update) includes enhancements to the Journaling feature that help make messaging data more manageable for a broader compliance solution.",
