    "detailsSection": "Authors: <i>Dominic Betts, Juli\u00e1n Dom\u00ednguez, Grigori  Melnik, Fernando Simonazzi, Mani Subramanian</i>.<br/>\r\nForeword by <i>Greg Young</i>.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThis guide is focused on building highly scalable, highly available, and maintainable applications with the <b>Command & Query Responsibility Segregation</b> and the <b>Event Sourcing</b> architectural patterns. It presents a learning journey, not definitive guidance. It describes the experiences of a development team with no prior CQRS proficiency in building, deploying (to Windows Azure), and maintaining a sample real-world, complex, enterprise system to showcase various CQRS and ES concepts, challenges, and techniques. The development team did not work in isolation; we actively sought input from industry experts and from a wide group of advisors to ensure that the guidance is both detailed and practical.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe CQRS pattern and event sourcing are not mere simplistic solutions to the problems associated with large-scale, distributed systems. By providing you with both a working application and written guidance, we expect you'll be well prepared to embark on your own CQRS journey.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe guide is split into three distinct sections that you can read independently: a description of the journey we took as we learned about CQRS, a collection of CQRS reference materials, and a collection of case studies that describe the experiences other teams have had with the CQRS pattern.
