    "detailsSection": "You can use Payables Management to maintain information about vendors, enter and post purchase transactions, and track payments to vendors. Individual posting accounts can be assigned to each vendor and you can store up to four types of transaction history for each vendor. Payments and credit documents can be applied to invoices and debit documents automatically, or individually. Payments can be generated using computer check runs or tracked after-the-fact as manual payments.<br />\r\n\r\nYou also can use Payables Management to complete the following tasks:\r\n<br />\n\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI>Specify vendors that 1099 information must be tracked for. You can print 1099 statements at any time.</LI>\r\n<LI>Manage disputes with vendors by placing a Hold status on selected vendor records. The Hold status prevents vendors from being paid until the hold is removed. Individual transactions also can be placed on hold. Transactions that are on hold can\u2019t be applied or paid.</LI>\r\n<LI>Manage payables accounts by reporting segments, such as cost center, division, department, program or fund. You can display a breakdown of your control payables account by account segment.</LI>\r\n</UL>",
