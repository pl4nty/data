    "detailsSection": "The CPDK contains documentation and code to help you develop cryptographic providers targeting the Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7 and Windows 8 Operating Systems. This development kit is an updated version of the Cryptographic Next Generation Software Development Kit (CNG SDK).<br/>\r\nThe header files, library files, samples and documentation provided in this release are subject to change, and may be updated in the future.<br/><br/>\r\n<b>What's New in v8.0</b><br/>\r\nThis release of the kit highlights the following changes: <br/>\r\n\u2022 Support for creating two new types of CNG providers, Key Derivation Function providers and Key Protection Providers.<br/>\r\n\u2022 Added Kernel Mode provider sample. <br/>\r\n\u2022 Code samples which demonstrate how to use the CNG API have been moved to the Windows SDK.<br/>\r\n\u2022 Samples have been updated for Visual Studio 2011.   <br/>\r\n\u2022 Documentation on how to implement a CAPI CSP and the required header and library files have also been included in the kit.<br/><br/>\r\n<b>Documentation<br/></b>\r\nThe Windows CPDK documentation contains API reference topics; task-based and how-to documentation. The Search bar, Index, Table of Contents, and the navigational topics in the documentation viewer are all available to help you locate the topics you need.<br/><br/>\r\n<b>Code<br/></b>\r\nThe Windows CPDK provides header files, libraries, and source code in the C/C++ language. All CPDK source code is installed to the \"Program Files\\Windows Kits\\8.0\\Cryptographic Provider Development Kit\" directory.<br/><br/>\r\n<b>Tools and Build Environments<br/></b>\r\nIn order to build the sample applications, you will need the Windows SDK. If you plan to build a kernel-mode provider like the BCRYPT client sample, you also need the Windows Device Driver Kit. The Microsoft website explains how to get the WDK: How to Get the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) .<br/>\r\nIn order to test the performance and implementation of your provider you may want to use the following test tools:<br/>\r\nCngbvt.exe: Validates algorithm implementations by calling the BCrypt APIs, with test data and validates the inputs and outputs.<br/>\r\nCryptoperf.exe: Measures the performance of the algorithm implementations. <br/><br/>\r\nNote: These tools are located in the Windows 8 version of the Windows Hardware Certification Kit and not the CPDK.<br/>\r\n",
