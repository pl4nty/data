    "detailsSection": "<a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=190624\">Microsoft StreamInsight</a> is a platform that enables the continuous and incremental processing of unbounded sequences of events (event streams) from multiple sources with near-zero latency. These requirements, shared by vertical markets such as manufacturing, oil and gas, utilities, financial services, health care, web analytics, and IT and data center monitoring, make traditional store and query techniques impractical for event driven, timely and relevant processing of data. The ability to monitor, analyze and act on data in motion provides significant opportunity to make more informed business decisions in near real-time.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nFurther resources can be found on the <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=224234\">MSDN Portal</a>, on the <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=204808\">StreamInsight Blog</a>, and on <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=204810\">CodePlex</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nMicrosoft StreamInsight 2.1 introduces a new object model that is more clear and consistent than in earlier versions, eliminating the need for complex input and output adapters. This new model allows you to provision, name, and manage data sources and sinks in the StreamInsight server, and you can checkpoint over temporal streams and across multiple processes. Moreover, this version of StreamInsight allows to tightly integrate reactive (Rx) and temporal queries within the same hosting model.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nA SQL Server 2012 license is required to install the full Microsoft StreamInsight 2.1 package.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nThe <b>Microsoft StreamInsight Client</b> package installs a subset of Microsoft StreamInsight which lets you implement only the client side functionality: Connecting to an existing StreamInsight server, managing queries, and using the debugger tool. It does not support running an embedded server or creating a StreamInsight service.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nA product key is not required to install the Microsoft\u00ae StreamInsight Client.\r\n<br/>\r\nMicrosoft\u00ae StreamInsight has two different methods to complete the installation process:\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> Attended Installation \u2013 an interactive user interface will guide you through the set-up process and obtain all of the information and consent required to complete the installation. This includes the displaying, acknowledgement, and archiving of the applicable SQL Server license terms.</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n    <li> Unattended Installation \u2013 this is a command line set-up process that does not have an interactive user interface to guide you through the set-up process.\r\n    In this case, you will be required to enter a parameter during installation that indicates your acceptance of the license terms.  <br/>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>",
