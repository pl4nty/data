One advantage of using host-named site collections in this manner is creating additional isolation between domain URLs, which might be desired in a partner collaboration solution. However, the tradeoff of this approach is the additional costs of managing a greater number of host names, including managing SSL certificates. Also, if SAML authentication is used, additional configuration is required.",
