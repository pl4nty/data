    "detailsSection": "Welcome to the Windows SDK July CTP release. The documentation, samples, and tools provided in this release are \n<u>preliminary</u> and <u>subject to change</u>. <BR/> <BR/> <b>It is recommended that you use this preliminary release of the Windows SDK \nin a test environment on a clean machine.</b> <BR/> <BR/>This CTP (Community Tech Preview) is intended for users of Windows Vista build 5456 and the .NET Framework 3.0 Runtime June CTP. This CTP contains updates for native Win32 developers, including improvements to documentation and samples. It is not supported for users running the Windows Vista Beta 2 for .NET Framework 3.0 development, but it will work for native Win32 applications on Windows Vista Beta 2. If you are using Windows Vista Beta 2 for .NET Framework 3.0 development, we recommend that you do not install this version of the SDK and instead use the <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=13F8E273-F5EA-4B7B-B022-97755838DB94&displaylang=en\">Windows SDK Beta 2 release</a>. The .NET Framework 3.0 July CTP runtime is a later version than the one that ships with Windows Vista Beta 2, and code that uses the .NET Framework 3.0 will not work with this CTP. \n\n<br/><br/>\n<b>IMPORTANT: </b> This version of the Microsoft Windows SDK is intended to support development targeting the following release:\n<br/><br/>\n<ul>\n<li><b>.NET Framework 3.0 July CTP</b></li>\n<LI><B>Windows Vista build 5472</B></LI>\n\n\n\n</ul><br/>\nThis release of \nthe Windows SDK is compatible with the RTM versions of Microsoft\u00ae \nVisual Studio\u00ae 2005.\n\n<br/><br/>\n===================================================\n<br/><br/>\n<b>NOTE:  There are a number of known issues with this release. Please consult the <a href=\"http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/4/4/544C02E0-6E73-48C7-85A5-42A1B8FB49F1/WinSDKJuneReadMe.Htm\">Readme</a> associated with this download for more information. </b> This version of the Windows SDK will\n\t<u>not</u> work with previous pre-release versions of Windows Vista, the .NET Framework 3.0 Runtime Components for Windows XP or Windows Server, nor pre-release versions of Visual Studio.\n\n\n<br/><br/>Please note that this download contains SDK content only. <b>To build .NET Framework 3.0 applications for Windows XP or Windows Server, the\n.NET Framework 3.0 Runtime Components for July CTP must be <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=8D09697E-4868-4D8D-A4CF-9B82A2AE542D&displaylang=en\">downloaded separately</a>.</b>\n\n<br/><br/>\n===================================================\n<br/><br/>\nThe Windows SDK includes <i>pre-release </i>content for application development with the APIs in Windows Vista, including the .NET Framework 3.0 technologies: .NET Framework 2.0, Windows\u00ae Presentation Foundation, Windows\u00ae Communications Foundation, and Windows\u00ae Workflow Foundation. Because the Windows SDK contains the former WinFX SDK content, the WinFX SDK is no longer released separately. \n\n<br/><br/><B>Documentation:</B> The Windows SDK documentation contains API reference topics; \ntask-based, how-to documentation; and feature overviews to help you develop applications\nusing Win32 and .NET Framework 3.0 APIs. Search, the Index, the Table of Contents, and the navigational \ntopics in the documentation viewer are all available to help you locate the topics you need.\n\n<br/><br/><B>Samples:</B> The Windows SDK code samples are provided in one or more of the following languages: Visual Basic, C#, and C++. All samples are \ninstalled to the Program Files\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v1.0\\Samples directory by default; however, users may install samples to a location that they choose. <br/><br/>For .NET Framework 3.0 samples, you can also locate, view, and download samples, organized by technology, by opening the Samples node in the .NET Framework 3.0 Development section of the Table of Contents. In addition, .NET Framework 3.0 samples are grouped by technology in zip files installed to the Program Files\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v1.0\\Samples directory. The zip files may be extracted to any location you choose.\n\n<br/><br/><B>Tools and Build Environments:</B> In addition to the headers and libraries used to build Windows applications, the Windows SDK also includes more than 100 GUI and command-line tools to aid in the development of native (Win32) and managed (.NET) systems for the Windows platform. The tools include command-line compilers (both 32 and 64-bit), debuggers, performance monitoring applications, security management utilities, and much more. <br/><br/><b>The \n<a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=1A994549-94CB-4F61-903D-A8C8E453EEF4&displaylang=en\">Microsoft Visual Studio Code Name \u201cOrcas\u201d Community Technology Preview \u2013 Development Tools for .NET Framework 3.0</a> </b>are available as a separate download. These Visual Studio tools provide developers with support for building .NET Framework 3.0 applications using the RTM version of Visual Studio 2005. This support includes Intellisense support, project templates, and documentation integration for .NET Framework 3.0.\n<br/><br/><B>IMPORTANT:</B> You must have matching versions of the .NET Framework 3.0 Runtime Components, \nWindows SDK, and Visual Studio Extensions in order to build .NET Framework 3.0 applications with Visual Studio. For this release, all must be either Beta 2 or June CTP releases. Older pre-release versions are no longer supported.\n<br/><br/>The Windows SDK contains pre-release documentation, samples, and tools designed to help you develop Windows applications and libraries using both Win32\u00ae and .NET Framework 3.0 technologies targeting Windows Vista.",
