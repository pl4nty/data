This template, based on the Visio 2010 Add-in for Rack Server Virtualization, provides shape stencils for racks and servers. You can use the template to create diagrams of the rack servers (including collocated servers) in your data center environment to help compare power consumption and space utilization before and after consolidating with virtualization. Documenting your server racks with this template can also help support personnel in managing your data center infrastructure.",
