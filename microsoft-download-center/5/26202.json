This paper will focus on issues related to the Windows HPC Server 2008 components that run on the cluster\u2019s head node, enabling you to plan, monitor, and tune the performance of these components.   This paper includes information about database configuration, disk space requirements, monitoring performance, and best practices.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThis paper will focus on issues related to the Windows HPC Server 2008 components, and not on the performance of applications running on the Windows HPC Server 2008 platform.  For information on performance analysis and tuning of HPC applications, please see the whitepaper entitled Performance Tuning a Windows HPC Cluster.",
