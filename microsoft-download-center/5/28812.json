    "detailsSection": "Business users at every level of your organization should have access to important data and be connected to processes that enable them to support operations. However, critical business data often is stored in disparate systems, and ad hoc processes block efficiencies. Users frequently call on IT to assist them in reaching and reconciling this business data, which can divert important IT resources away from strategic work that positions IT as a business partner, rather than a cost center.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nThis white paper is intended for enterprise architects who have the challenge of providing organizations and end users with an easier way to access the information locked in back-end systems. Using the interoperability capabilities of Microsoft SharePoint Server Server 2010\u2014including Business Connectivity Services\u2014IT can build cost-effective, manageable integrations to deliver increased productivity and return on investment (ROI) to their business clients. <br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nYou can also download information about these solutions from the perspective of <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=28133\">technical decision makers</a> or <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=28156\">business decision makers</a>.
