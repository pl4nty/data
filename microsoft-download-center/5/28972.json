Download and install the version that matches the architecture of the computer on which you plan to install the administration tools.  If you are not sure whether your computer is x86- or x64-based, see <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/827218\">How to determine whether a computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system</a>.\n<br /><br />\r\nRemote Server Administration Tools for Windows 8 is available in the following languages:  cs-CZ, de-DE, en-US, es-ES, fr-FR, hu-HU, it-IT, ja-JP, ko-KR, nl-NL, pl-PL, pt-BR, pt-PT, ru-RU, sv-SE, tr-TR, zh-CN, zh-HK, and zh-TW. If the system UI language of your Windows 8 operating system does not match any of the available RSAT languages, you must first install a Windows 8 Language Pack for a language that is supported by RSAT, and then try installing Remote Server Administration Tools for Windows 8 again. Install supported language packs from Windows Update by using instructions in the following KB article: <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2607607\">Windows 8 language packs are available for computers that are running Windows 8</a>.\r\n<br /><br />\n<b>IMPORTANT:</b>  Remove all older versions of Administration Tools Pack or Remote Server Administration Tools\u2014including earlier prerelease versions, and releases of the tools for different languages or locales\u2014from the computer before you install Remote Server Administration Tools for Windows 8. Only one copy at a time of Remote Server Administration Tools can be installed on a computer. If you have upgraded to Windows 8 from Windows 7, you will need to install Remote Server Administration Tools for Windows 8 on the computer; no earlier releases of Remote Server Administration Tools are still installed on a computer that you have upgraded to Windows 8. \n<br /><br />\nRemote Server Administration Tools for Windows 8 includes support for remote management of computers that are running the Server Core installation option or the Minimal Server Graphical Interface configuration of Windows Server 2012, and in limited cases, the Server Core installation options of Windows Server 2008 R2, or Windows Server 2008. However, Remote Server Administration Tools for Windows 8 cannot be installed on any versions of the Windows Server operating system.\n<br /><br />\nEarlier releases of Remote Server Administration Tools (such as those for Windows 7) are not available--nor do they run--on Windows 8. Remote Server Administration Tools for Windows 8 can be used to manage some roles and features that run on Windows Server 2008 R2, but has limited functionality managing roles on servers that are running releases of Windows Server that are older than Windows Server 2012. For a table describing the available tools and the versions of roles and features that they support, see <a href=\"http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/2202.remote-server-administration-tools-rsat-for-windows-vista-windows-7-windows-8-release-preview-windows-server-2008-windows-server-2008-r2-and-windows-server-2012-dsforum2wiki.aspx\">Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT) for Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, and Windows Server 2012</a>.\n<br /><br />\nServer Manager is included with Remote Server Administration Tools for Windows 8; GUI-based tools that are part of this release of Remote Server Administration Tools can be opened by using commands on the Tools menu of the Server Manager console. To use Server Manager to access and manage remote servers that are running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2008 R2, you must install several updates on the older operating systems.
