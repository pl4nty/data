These columns are the following:\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI><B>Reboot Required</B>: A \"Yes\" in this column means that the Windows operating systems requires a restart before it applies the described policy setting.</LI>\r\n<LI><B>Logoff Required</B>: A \"Yes\" in this column means that the Windows operating system requires the user to log off and log on again before it applies the described policy setting.</LI>\r\n<LI><B>Active Directory Schema or Domain Requirements</B>: A \"Yes\" in this column means that you must extend the Active Directory schema before you can deploy this policy setting.</LI>\r\n<LI><B>Status</B>: A \"New\" in this column means that the setting did not exist prior to Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows 8.1. It does not mean that the setting applies only to Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows 8.1. Refer to the column entitled \"supported on\" to determine to which operating system the policy setting applies.\r\n</LI></UL>\r\n",
