The feature-rich reporting capabilities of Microsoft Project Professional 2010, Project Server 2010, and Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010 are enabled, and that planning and reporting is put directly in the hands of the end users.\r\n\r\nThis white paper is not a Detailed Technical Systems or programming write-up, but a customer solutions case study focused on the value of systems integration of a Project and Resource Planning Organization.",
