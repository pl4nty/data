Microsoft EPM Solution relies on Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010, Microsoft SQL Server 2008 or 2008 R2, Microsoft Project Server 2010, and Microsoft Project Professional 2010. Although each individual component of the solution is well documented on TechNet and MSDN (for Business Intelligence), little documentation exists, as of today, that describes a step-by-step approach to building reports specific to Project Server 2010 data with Excel and Excel Services.  For related information, see the <a href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-US/projectserver/ff513702.aspx\">Business Intelligence Resource Center</a> for Project Server 2010.",
