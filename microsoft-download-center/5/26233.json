The Microsoft Visio 2010 Add-in for Rack Server Virtualization uses several new features in Visio 2010 to display the details of your servers and racks before and after virtualizing. With the add-in, you can get a consolidated view of your physical racks, servers and colos (collocated equipment), providing a side-by-side view of both their existing status and their proposed status after virtualization. The add-in provides a virtualization configuration wizard that helps you manage the virtualization process; easily document racks, servers and colos; and compare the power consumption and space utilization of your data center before and after virtualization.",
