You can use a Bubble chart if your data has three data series, each of which contains a set of values. The article presents an example of creating a Bubble chart that can be changed dynamically by applying filters. By avoiding the use of macros, the chart is compatible with Excel Services.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are various examples on the web that provide macros and scripts to create Bubble charts dynamic series by using macros; however, those methods are seldom sufficient when you want to publish the Excel sheets by using Excel Services because Excel Services doesn\u2019t support macros. The example provided uses built-in Excel functions to generate the series data dynamically, and hence, because it doesn't use macros, it is completely compatible with Excel Services.<br />\r\n<br />",
