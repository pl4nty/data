This sample shows how you can use Visio 2010 to track the deployment, configuration, and usage status of different IT assets, such as file servers, web servers, and database servers. It uses built-in shapes in Visio 2010 for rack-mounted equipment, servers, network and peripherals, and network locations, automatically linked to imported sample data. By customizing the sample diagram and linking to your own data, such as from your management software, you can quickly build an at-a-glance view into your IT asset inventory. You could also use a sample like this to document the proposed configuration and topology of new IT assets.",
