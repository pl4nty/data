The reports allow a database administrator to quickly identify whether there is a current bottleneck on their system, and if a bottleneck is present, capture additional diagnostic data that may be necessary to resolve the problem. <br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nCommon performance problems that the dashboard reports may help to resolve include:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>CPU bottlenecks (and what queries are consuming the most CPU)</li>\r\n<li>IO bottlenecks (and what queries are performing the most IO)</li>\r\n<li>Index recommendations generated by the query optimizer (missing indexes)</li>\r\n<li>Blocking</li>\r\n<li>Latch contention</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe information captured in the reports is retrieved from SQL Server's dynamic management views. There is no additional tracing or data capture required, which means the information is always available and this is a very inexpensive means of monitoring your server.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nReporting Services is not required to be installed to use the Performance Dashboard Reports.",
