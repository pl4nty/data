With the Microsoft Visio 2010 Add-in for Exchange Server, your administrators can get a graphical view of user mailbox details in Exchange Server 2010 or Exchange Server 2007. Instead of viewing single user data, administrators can create data-linked Visio diagrams that display Exchange data, such as sites and servers, at a glance, helping dramatically increase productivity. \r\nIn addition to the client component, the add-in also has a server component. With the server component, you can publish your data-linked diagram to Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010 through Visio Services and refresh it in real time, making the latest information broadly available through a browser.\r\n\r\n",
