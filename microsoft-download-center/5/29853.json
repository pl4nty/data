MVP Sessions Video 19 covers several simplified diagramming features of Visio 2010, such as visual indicators when shapes are aligned and evenly spaced, autoconnect triangles and the quick shape menu for adding connectors or shapes with a single click, and containers for managing swim lane diagrams.
