To execute and debug XNA Framework games for Windows Phone with the Windows Phone emulator, you need a graphics card that supports, at minimum, DirectX 10, with a supporting WDDM 1.1 driver.  To develop XNA Framework games for Xbox 360, you need a hard disk installed on your Xbox 360 console.  Other hardware requirements for XNA Game Studio 4.0 are identical to those for Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.",
