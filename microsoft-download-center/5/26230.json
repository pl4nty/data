The Microsoft Visio 2010 Add-in for Disk Space Monitoring has two components: client component and server component. The client component uses the new data graphics feature of Visio 2010 to display the results of server monitoring. It integrates with Microsoft System Center Operations Manager 2007 to get the disk free space details. And the server component makes it possible to publish the data-linked diagram to Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010 and refresh it in real time, making the information broadly available through a browser.\r\n",
