To save time and effort, you can download our example diagrams and modify them to suit your organization.  \r\nThere are two diagrams available for you to download: \r\n(1) Balanced Scorecard Sample Diagram contains lots of shapes representing a wide range of key performance indicators (KPIs) for the Financial, Customer, Internal, and Learning & Growth perspectives. This diagram is representative of KPIs that a typical organization would use in a strategy map as part of a Balanced Scorecard.  \r\n(2) Balanced Scorecard Sample Diagram (small) is a pared-down diagram that corresponds to the strategy map we create in the article \u201cCreate a PerformancePoint strategy map as part of a Balanced Scorecard\u201d (http://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh750369) on TechNet. This diagram contains fourteen shapes that correspond to KPIs in an example scorecard that is used as part of a Balanced Scorecard.",
