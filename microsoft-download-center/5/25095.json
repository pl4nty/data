Run this file on either 32-bit or 64-bit supported Windows operating systems.  These license files are required for the KMS host service to recognize Office 2010 KMS host keys.  It will also prompt you to enter your Office 2010 KMS host key and activate that key.  After this is done, you may need to use the slmgr.vbs script to further configure your KMS host.\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>Note: Online activation and phone activation are now supported on Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012</b>",
