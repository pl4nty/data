    "detailsSection": "Business users at every level of your organization should have access to important data and be connected to processes that enable them to support operations. However, critical business data often is stored in disparate systems and ad hoc processes block efficiencies. Users call on IT to assist them in reaching and reconciling this business data, which can divert important IT resources away from strategic work that positions IT as a business partner, rather than a cost center.\r\nThis white paper is intended for Chief Information Officers, Chief Technical Officers, infrastructure managers and information system managers who want to deliver business-critical solutions while driving business value and reducing business risk. These solutions can be implemented across the organization and empower business users to get more value out of line-of-business (LOB) systems, thus extending the reach of important business data and improving business processes. This can be accomplished by connecting LOB applications to Microsoft SharePoint 2010 to organize and facilitate broad access to previously siloed information.\r\nThis white paper explains how to: \r\n - Increase access to critical backend business data by surfacing it in SharePoint 2010.\r\n - Enhance the effectiveness of business processes by building on SharePoint 2010 and using its platform capabilities.\r\n - Deliver fast return on investment (ROI) by lowering business risk, decreasing training costs and enhancing compliance.",
