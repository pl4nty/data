This sample shows how the PivotDiagram functionality in Visio can be used to create a hierarchical view of project data. The diagram automatically generates based on a linked or embedded data set. \r\n\r\nThis sample diagram uses embedded shape data to illustrate two views of how a firm\u2019s efforts to recruit new hires are progressing (by unfilled positions and by recruiter). The embedded shapes used in this sample could also be used to build a scorecard that shows the status of virtually any project or ongoing work stream, such as customer support effectiveness or sales performance.\r\n",
