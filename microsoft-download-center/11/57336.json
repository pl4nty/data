    "detailsSection": "As of November 07, 2018, we will retire the Global Service Monitor and recommend our customers  to migrate GSM tests to Azure Application Insights well before that date. The migration script will provision your tests with the same configuration in Application Insights as you have in GSM. The migration script will also provision alert rules based on what you are currently using in SCOM.  This tool will create new Ping tests and Web tests in Application Insights. This tool will not impact customer's SCOM GSM environment and GSM tests in SCOM will continue to work till November 7th 2018. Post November 7th 2018, we recommend deleting GSM MP from the SCOM server. \r\nIf customers want to bring the Alerts data back in SCOM, they can use Azure MP at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=50013 \r\nWe recommend customers to run this tool well before November 07, 2018.\r\n",
