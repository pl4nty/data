More than just searching a database, we believe the next generation of conversational agents will need to help users explore a database, compare items, and reach a decision.",

    "detailsSection": "The dialogues in Frames were collected in a Wizard-of-Oz fashion. Two humans talked to each other via a chat interface. One was playing the role of the user and the other one was playing the role of the conversational agent. We call the latter a wizard as a reference to the Wizard of Oz, the man behind the curtain. The wizards had access to a database of 250+ packages, each composed of a hotel and round-trip flights. We gave users a few constraints for each dialogue and we asked them to find the best deal. This resulted in complex dialogues where a user would often consider different options, compare packages, and progressively build the description of her ideal trip.",
