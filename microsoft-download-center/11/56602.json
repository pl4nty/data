This is an important added benefit as it enables companies still on Windows 7 Pro or Windows 8/8.1 Pro to move to the most secure Windows ever without the need to purchase additional device upgrade licenses. This document explains how businesses can upgrade PCs and devices still running Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to Windows 10 at no additional cost via upgrade benefits included with Windows subscriptions (including Microsoft 365 offerings) in the CSP program.",
