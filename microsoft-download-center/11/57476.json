    "detailsSection": "This guide offers optimization advice for executing point-lookups against SQL Server from .NET as efficiently as possible. Customers wishing to migrate from mainframe databases to SQL Server may desire to migrate existing mainframe-optimized design patterns, especially when using 3rd party tools (such as Raincode Compiler) to automatically migrate mainframe code (COBOL/JCL etc) to T-SQL and C# .NET. \r\nMainframe data accesses commonly employ Point-Lookups (AKA \u2018Singleton Reads\u2019) to loop through and join multiple large tables. This data access pattern is optimal for mainframe, but is suboptimal for querying SQL Server via .NET, where batching is recommended.  \r\n",
