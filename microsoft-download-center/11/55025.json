Import the mp file into SCOM machine to apply this fix. <br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nFor agents running under Gateways servers, one needs to configure the Automatic Agent Management Account, that is used to automatically diagnose agent failures (eg. heartbeat failures, failure to receive data) to have a RunAs account that has privileges to both the Management Server and the Gateway. This would be possible only in scenarios where \r\n<li> 1. The gateway is a member of a trusted forest (which has SCOM Servers), but outside a Kerberos realm.  (Gateway is used because Kerberos is unavailable) </li>\r\n<li> 2. The gateway is a member of the same forest as the SCOM servers.  (Gateway is used for firewall/bandwidth/local resource pool scenario) </li>",
