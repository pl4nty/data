One of the SIPs supports the Open Office XML file formats, and the other supports all other supported file formats. A SIP is a library that integrates with the Windows Operating System cryptographic stack to enable the OS to perform cryptographic operations on file formats for which the OS is not aware by default.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nOnce installed, existing tools and code that utilize the Windows cryptographic APIs to sign and verify files can be additionally used to sign and verify Office files containing VBA projects.",
