    "detailsSection": "No application is an island. Whether we like it or not, tying systems together has become the norm. Yet connecting software is about more than just exchanging bytes. As organizations move toward a service-oriented world, the real goal\u2014creating effective business processes that unite separate systems into a coherent whole\u2014comes within reach.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft BizTalk Server 2009 supports this goal. Like its predecessors, this latest release allows connecting diverse software, then graphically creating and modifying process logic that uses that software. BizTalk Server also enables information workers to monitor running processes, interact with trading partners, and perform other business-oriented tasks.",
