    "detailsSection": "This paper introduces a new technique that can produce compact software updates optimized for any origin/destination revision pair. It does this by calculating forward the differential of a changed file from the base version and its reverse differential back to the base version. Both forward and reverse differentials are then packaged as an update and distributed to the endpoints running the software to be updated. This method results in a single update package that is compact, applicable to all baselines, simple to build, efficient to install, and redistributable.\r\n",
