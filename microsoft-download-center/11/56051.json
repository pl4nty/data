Install Lingering Object Liquidator on the same computer.<br />\r\n3. Permissions: The user account running the tool must have Domain Admin credentials for each domain in the forest targeted by Lingering Object Liquidator. Members of the Enterprise Admins group have domain admin credentials in all domains within a forest by default. Domain Admin credentials are sufficient in a single domain or single domain forest.<br />\r\n4. The admin workstation must have full port and protocol connectivity to all DCs in all domains targeted for the discovery and removal of lingering objects. Specific ports include DNS, Kerberos, RPC, LDAP and the ephemeral port range in use by the targeted DC. While pre-Windows Server 2008 DCs use the \u201clow\u201d ephemeral port range between 1024 and 5000, such DCs are not compatible with Lingering Object Liquidator so those ports don't need to be considered.  Post-Windows Server 2003 DCs use the \u201chigh\u201d ephemeral port range between 49152 to 65535 so the tool will need connectivity over that range. See <a href=\"https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd772723(v=ws.10).aspx\">TechNet</a> for more detail. <br />\r\n5. You must enable the Remote Event Log Management (RPC) firewall rule on each DC that will be scanned by the tool. Otherwise, Lingering Object Liquidator displays an error stating, \u201cException: The RPC server is unavailable\u201d<br />\r\n6. The liquidation of lingering objects in AD Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS / ADAM) environments is not supported.<br />\r\n7. The liquidation of lingering objects using this tool is not supported on domain controllers running Windows Server 2003 R2 or earlier (the tool leverages the event log subscription feature which wasn\u2019t added until Windows Server 2008).<br />",
