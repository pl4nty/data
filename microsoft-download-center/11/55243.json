    "detailsSection": "Cloud computing has become ubiquitous, and cloud services\u2014such as Office 365\u2014can be an attractive alternative to on-premises SharePoint business solutions. However, for a variety of reasons, you might want or need to deploy specific solutions in the cloud while still maintaining your on-premises SharePoint Server farm. Some enterprises may wish to gradually move their existing on-premises SharePoint Server services to the cloud, using a staged migration in which SharePoint Server workloads are moved one at a time to SharePoint Online or Office 365. Hybrid functionality in on-premises SharePoint and Office 365 enables you to extend your on-premises investment to the cloud by integrating services like SharePoint Search, Office 365 Video, Microsoft Business Connectivity Services (BCS), Microsoft OneDrive for Business, Microsoft Office Delve, Microsoft Yammer, and Microsoft/SAP Duet Enterprise Online.",
