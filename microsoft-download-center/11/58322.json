The test kit mocks all operations of Azure File Sync and validates the behavior of antivirus using its comprehensive set of tests, and then produces user-friendly test results. The test kit helps identify the \u2018unnecessary\u2019 file reads of AFS tiered files, which often results in unexpected data egress from the cloud. Antivirus vendors can use the test kit to collect their product logs during the test run for further investigations. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Antivirus Compatibility Test Suite has two components: \r\n<ul> \r\n<li>StorageSync.sys: The Azure File Sync file system filter, which is responsible for tiering files to Azure Files (when cloud tiering is enabled).</li>\r\n<li>AVCompatTestSuite.dll: Defines a comprehensive list of tests, that are executed using the TAEF framework and produces easy to understand results.</li> \r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\nThe test suite utilizes the Test Authoring and Execution Framework (TAEF) that is publicly available as part of the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) or standalone installation.",
