For this purpose, we\u2019ve created a separate sample data installation package (English-language only at this time) that makes it easier to learn about these solutions. Running this Package Deployer install performs the following actions:\r\n\u2022 Creates or sets default parameters that drive behavior of Field Service and Project Service\r\n\u2022 Imports sample data such as Bookable Resources, Roles, Sales and Cost Price lists, Organizational Units, relevant sales process records, Work Orders and Projects\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT:  There is no way to un-install this sample data. Therefore, you should only use this package on demonstration, evaluation, training and test systems.\r\n\r\nNote: This release is updated for TLS 2.0 support.",
