It is the same tool used by Microsoft's internal product groups to catalogue changes made to operating system attack surface by the installation of new software.  <b>This</b> version represents a rewrite of the classic tool 1.0 version of the tools released in 2012 which was dedicated to older versions of Windows.<br /><br/>\r\n\r\nAttack Surface Analyzer takes a snapshot of your system state before and after the installation of other software product(s) and displays changes to a number of key elements of the system attack surface.  It also allows developers to view changes in the attack surface resulting from the introduction of their code to assess the aggregate attack surface of an organization's line of business applications or on potential customer systems.\r\n\r\n",
