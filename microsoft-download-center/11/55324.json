This dataset (IGC) includes image-grounded conversations consisting of an image, a question, a response, and up to four further responses, which together constitute a conversation. In addition, we provide up to four additional questions that could have been asked, and up to four additional responses to a first question, so that the diversity of possible questions and answers can be studied. We provide a test set and a development set, each with approximately 5K images. This dataset is described in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08251\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08251</a>.\r\n",
