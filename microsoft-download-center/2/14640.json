This makes it straightforward for board makers, device makers, and developers of Windows SideShow-capable devices to port the .NET Micro Framework to new hardware platforms.<br />\n<br />\nThis white paper introduces the .NET Micro Framework architecture with a view toward porting it to a new hardware platform. It then discusses the essentials of the porting process, including the structure of the .NET Micro Framework Porting Kit, the required skill sets, estimates for resource commitments, and contact information for taking the next step.",
