This book is not trying<br />\nto be an authoritative reference for service orientation. Rather, presented here is an interesting<br />\nset of classical papers on architecting services by a variety of well-known authors in<br />\nthe architectural space. The topics, or architectural viewpoints covered, go from a perspective<br />\non business architecture, through model-based tools, to map from the business to<br />\ntechnology to the choices in new IT infrastructure.",
