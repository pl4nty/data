You can help protect your computer by installing this update from Microsoft. <br />\n<br />\nThis update uses Windows Installer technology which uses an internal database for recording the installation state for any products and patches based on Windows Installer technology. Under certain conditions the Windows Installer database may contain invalid file hashes for un-versioned files, and when you try to install an update you may see a prompt for providing the source CD or other media that was used for installing the original product. Running the update may result in an update to the Windows Installer database on your PC to rectify this problem.",
