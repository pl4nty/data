    "detailsSection": "HPC Services for Excel supports a variety of new programming models that allow you to run Excel calculations in parallel on a Windows HPC 2008 R2 cluster. HPC Services for Excel is based on the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) programming model, and includes a built-in SOA client and a built-in service. This article walks through three basic patterns for creating client applications that use the built-in HPC/Excel service: the simple model, the interactive model, and the fire-and-recollect model. The article also walks through building a custom service library, and an application that utilizes the custom service. As we go through the code examples, we\u2019ll discuss when it\u2019s appropriate to use custom clients and services, and the types of applications that you can build. <br /><br />\r\nThe associated zip file includes: <br />\r\n<ul><li>Sample client and service solutions for Visual Studio 2008 and Visual Studio 2010</li>\r\n<li>Microsoft.Hpc.Excel.dll </li>\r\n<li>A batch file that includes the commands to deploy a service DLL to a cluster</li>\r\n<li>A template for the service configuration file</li></ul>\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<b>Note:</b> Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular purpose.\r\n",
