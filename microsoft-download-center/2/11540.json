The HPC Class library includes the APIs that a client application can use to create sessions on the cluster. The APIs support creating reliable sessions and client interaction models such as file and recollect, batch, and shared session clients. This article also addresses the service configuration file, the Windows HPC infrastructure that supports SOA workloads, and broker node and session management and monitoring.\r\n",
