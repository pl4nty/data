    "detailsSection": "Overall, parents surveyed rank the risks of online gaming for their kids low compared to other online activities. And while they report that the steps they\u2019ve taken to help protect their children are effective, most are not using available family safety settings. \r\n\r\n\u2022 13% of parents ranked online gaming as their top concern compared to online chatting (43%) and browsing social networks (20%).\r\n\u2022 40% report using available family safety settings. Fifty four percent reported not using them because they trust their child and 53% said they don\u2019t use them due to lack of awareness or lack of understanding how to find/use them.\r\n\r\nEven though parents ranked the concerns of online gaming low,  many gamers themselves reported experiencing abuse online\u2014and for younger gamers, the abuse has impacted  their online gaming behavior. \r\n\r\n\u2022 One in five gamers reported experiencing abuse while gaming online. \r\n\u2022 The results showed that gamers aged 18-24 (24%) are twice as likely as gamers under 18 (12%) to experience abuse.\r\n\u2022 Most gamers, 71%, claim they know what to do when they encounter abuse online, but many (44%) do not report it.\r\n\u2022 Two-thirds of gamers under 18 have either stopped playing online games or play them less due to a previous bad experience.\r\n",
