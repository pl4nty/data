When a primary care provider (PCP)has a specific question for a specialist about a particular aspect of a patient\u2019s care they can quickly check for the specialist online and initiates a virtual consultation wherever the specialist is at that time. They can initiate a text, audio or video communications session from any device and even open a shared, secure workspace to view images together as they talk. The patient can participate from the PCP office, family members can participate remotely and other members of the care team can be brought into the virtual consultation as appropriate.",
