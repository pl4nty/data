To install the Productivity Hub solution, you must have Service Pack 1 or later of Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 Standard edition or Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 Enterprise edition already installed and configured. <br /><br />\r\n\r\nAdd-on Content Package<br />\r\nThis content package contains more than 200 additional training materials that you can add to the Microsoft Productivity Hub. The package includes materials for five new products -- Live Meeting, OneNote, Project, Publisher, and Visio -- as well as additional content for Access, Communicator, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, SharePoint, and Word. Install the Hub before using this content package. The 2007 Productivity Hub v3 contains all content packages that have been released through September 2010. You do not need to download these packages separately.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nSearch<br />\r\nTo enable the search capabilities within the Productivity Hub, a Shared Services Provider must be associated with the Productivity Hub site collection and configured to search the Productivity Hub site collection. <br /><br />\r\n\r\nDisk Space<br />\r\nOnce installed, the solution consumes roughly 2.3 gigabytes of disk space. The majority of this is content (e.g. large video files and Office System documents) which SharePoint manages via its content database.",
