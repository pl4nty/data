These guides continue to provide value for users, but because they were developed in 2003, they contain some outdated content.

The third chapter takes a more detailed look at the tasks described in the maintenance chapter. The fourth chapter organizes tasks by the MOF role cluster responsible for each task. Chapter five provides information about common troubleshooting techniques for the Windows Server 2003 DHCP service. The sixth chapter contains an appendix with information about DHCP log events and system monitoring.<br />\r\n<br />Send questions or feedback to us directly at <a href=\"mailto:satfdbk@microsoft.com\">satfdbk@microsoft.com</a>.\r\n",
