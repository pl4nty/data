In the scenario, sales data is first analyzed in Excel. Additional sales and promotions data is then imported into PowerPivot for Excel, and the data is further analyzed. After the analysis is complete, it is published to the PowerPivot Gallery in SharePoint and distributed via Reporting Services, enabling others in the company to interact with the analysis and develop additional insights. The scenario document that is available from the Microsoft Download Center provides step-by-step guidance, and the accompanying sample data lets you follow along with the document. \r\nThere are three files available for this scenario:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><b>SelfServiceAnalytics.docx</b>: Detailed description of the scenario, with steps to follow along.</li>\r\n<li><b>SelfServiceAnalytics.pdf</b>: Interactive diagram that shows a visual flow of tasks. </li>\r\n<li><b>SelfServiceAnalytics_SampleData.zip</b>: Access databases and Excel workbooks that are used in the scenario.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThe document and sample data are required, and the diagram is helpful in understanding the sequence of tasks.",
