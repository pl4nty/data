Unfortunately, the technology used on the two sites was not directly compatible. Geddes Group contracted with development partner Personify Design to build a Web services interface to tie Amazon.com's Apache-based platform to Geddes' existing Microsoft Windows\u2013based back-end infrastructure. <br />\n<br />\nAfter considering IBM Alphaworks and Systinet WASP, Personify chose to implement the interface with Microsoft  Visual C# .NET and the .NET Framework. The product was brought to market in three months, which met Geddes' aggressive schedule, and the interface tested out at over 100 transactions per second.",
