After the .NET assembly is created, a Dexterity script is created that calls and tests the code in the assembly. <br /><br />\nThe C# class created for this example is a simple. However, more complex projects can be created and used successfully. <br /><br />\nThis example was created and tested using the following:\n<UL><LI>Microsoft Dynamics GP 10.0 SP2</LI>\n<LI>Microsoft Dexterity 10.0.313</LI>\n<LI>Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 SP1</LI></UL>",
