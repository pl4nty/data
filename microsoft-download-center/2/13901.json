    "detailsSection": "The objective of this lab is to familiarize you with using the Tablet PC RealTimeStylus (RTS) APIs. To do so, you will create a pair of RTS plug-ins. The first plug-in is a packet filtering plug-in that demonstrates packet modification by constraining all (x,y) packet data within a rectangular area. The second plug-in is a custom dynamic renderer plug-in that renders stylus input by drawing a small circle around each (x,y) point. You will then use your plug-ins in a sample application that is provided for you.",
