Cloud computing can help improve the security profiles of healthcare organizations by shifting the burden of assuring safe, secure computing practices to cloud service providers. Expanding regulation and ongoing fragmentation in the medical industry require increased attention from healthcare organizations; using the expertise and experience of cloud service providers to maintain secure operations is a reallocation of responsibility that makes good sense. And a cloud-based electronic health record (EHR) solution could address the needs of medical practitioners while reducing or mitigating risk.\r\n",
