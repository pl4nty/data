The LSS can simulate all Lync Server workloads or just specific workloads, such as instant messaging (IM) and presence, application sharing, audio conferencing, and mobility, with a particular scale target.\r\nThis test plan will take you through the steps required to plan and conduct a Lync Server 2013 stress testing exercise, and it will help you analyze the results in order to conclude whether the initial capacity plan is sound or requires adjustment. \r\n\r\n",
