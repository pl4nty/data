First is the paper that details the agreement for STSs to Interop with Azure Active Directory using the WS-Federation and WS-Trust protocols. The second is the paper which specifies the scenarios for STS testing that Microsoft use for qualification in the Works with Office 365 - Identity program. The third is the program guide for partners for the Works with Office 365 - Identity program. This enables use of a third party Identity Provider to be used for authentication by Office 365 and other Microsoft services that use Azure Active Directory.",
