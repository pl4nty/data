    "detailsSection": "<b style=\"color:red\">\r\n[Update]\r\n<br/>\r\n<u>Note: </u>Update Rollup 9 for Service Manager 2012 R2 is now available for download, you can get it from here - <a href=\"http://aka.ms/sm2012R2ur7\">http://aka.ms/smr2ur9</a>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nThe Service Manager update rollups are cumulative, UR9 contains new updates in addition to all the payload which was shipped in <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3063263\">UR7</a>,<a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3039363\">UR6</a>, <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3009517\">UR5</a>, <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2989601\">UR4</a>, <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2962041\">UR3</a>, and <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2904710\">UR2</a>. You can directly patch SM 2012 R2 deployment with UR9 to get all the fixes together.\r\n<b>Please be aware</b> that UR9 release does not contain the payload of Update Rollup 8 (https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3124091), because UR8 contains the new HTML based Self Service Portal and requires separate installation.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nHence, now we are removing the Update Rollup 3 files from this Download Center page and those files will be available for on-demand in special cases only. Feel free to reach us at <u>ServiceManager@microsoft.com</u> in case of any queries or concerns.\r\n<br/>\r\n</b>\r\n----------------------------\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nThis update contains a set of bug fixes to the System Center 2012 R2 Service Manager release. It should be applied to all Service Manager 2012 R2 server installations. There are three executable files available: <br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nSCSM2012R2_CU_KB2904710_AMD64_7.5.3079.148.exe <br/>\r\nSCSM2012R2_CU_KB2904710_i386_7.5.3079.148.exe<br/>\r\nOMCIConnector_SyncMetadata_UpdateTimestamp.exe<br/>\r\n\r\n\r\nBug fixes included in this update::\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Operations Manager CI Connector does not retrieve disk mount point information from SCOM</li>\r\n<li>When creating a Service Request from a Request Offering in the console, for every user prompt with prompt type Simple List, the console shows options from all simple lists in each user prompts.</li>\r\n<li>Customized Change Requests cannot be closed. When trying to close a customized Change Request - the task throws an error and the close is not actioned. </li>\r\n<li>MPSync job failures logged to the event log do not contain enough information to enable quick diagnosis of the problem</li>\r\n<li>All Service Manager workflows may stall when any invalid XML characters (control characters) are used in a work item property</li>\r\n<li>Using the \u201cSet First Response or Comment\u201d Task in n service request creates a \u201cPrivate\u201d flag which can\u2019t be used for evaluation in a notification action log/user comment update due to its undefined. </li>\r\n<li>If the CMDB is down (offline/unable to connect/network issues) at the time that the HealthService has been restarted, and it continues to be offline for an extended period of time, the HealthService may get into an unrecoverable state even if the DB is later back up again.</li>\r\n<li>SCCM connector synchronization may stop after applying Service Manager 2012 SP1 UR2 or Service Manager 2012 R2 UR6. This happens when the connector tries to synchronize malformed / incomplete software version information from their SCCM database.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n",
