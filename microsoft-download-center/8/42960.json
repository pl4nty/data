The platform uses industry standard servers, disks, and JBOD enclosures. With the block storage made available through Storage Spaces combined with the Scale-Out File Server in a failover cluster, we can deliver extremely high levels of storage performance and resiliency similar to a traditional SAN using Microsoft Storage Solution and inexpensive shared Direct Attached Storage. \r\nThe results demonstrate the levels of storage performance that can be achieved from virtual machines running Hyper-V a single  Scale-Out File Server using shared Storage Spaces:\r\n<ul><li> 1.1 million IOPS for 8 KB random reads</li>\r\n<li>700K IOPS for 8 KB random writes</li>\r\n<li>100 Gbps aggregate read bandwidth</li>\r\n<li>92 Gbps aggregate write bandwidth</li></ul>",
