This covers only a fraction of the speakers and languages worldwide.  Locale Builder is intended to allow system administrators, vendors, developers and users to provide their own formatting data for cases when support is not provided in box.<br/>\r\n<br />\r\nLocale Builder allows the user to extend and modify the set of locales that Microsoft ships with his or her own regional and cultural data.  This application was created to support users in regions without built-in Windows locales, as well as users seeking to modify locales that they are already using.  With Locale Builder, users are able to add formatting support on their own timeline without the need to wait for new releases of Windows.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLocale Builder also allows corporations, governments, universities, and special-interest groups to easily create custom locales on Windows 8.1.<br/>\r\n<br />\r\nThis version of Locale Builder replaces the obsolete Microsoft Locale Builder (beta 2), and has been updated to run on Windows 10.<br/>\r\n",
