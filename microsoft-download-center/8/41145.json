Microsoft Enterprise Library helps accelerate development by providing reusable components and guidance on  proven practices. This guide helps you to quickly grasp what Enterprise Library v6 can do for you, presents examples that show it in action, and makes it easier for you to start experimenting with Enterprise Library. <br /><br/>\r\nEnterprise Library is made up of a series of application blocks, each aimed at managing specific crosscutting concerns. You can use them out of the box, modify them as required, and distribute them with your applications. The main themes for the latest v6 release are: simplifying the library all around, embracing semantic logging, increasing resiliency to errors, and streamlining programmatic configuration of all blocks. <br /><br/>\r\nThe main themes for the latest v6 release are: <b>simplifying</b> the library all around, embracing <b>semantic logging</b>, increasing <b>resiliency</b> to errors, supporting <b>Windows Store apps</b> (Unity, Transient Fault Handling), and streamlining <b>programmatic configuration</b> of all blocks. <br /><br/>\r\nThe guide explains the concepts that drove development of the blocks, the kinds of tasks they can accomplish, and how they help you implement many well-known design patterns. And, of course, it explains \u2014 by way of code extracts and sample programs \u2014 how you can actually use the blocks in your applications. Benefit from the capabilities of Enterprise Library, spend more time focusing on your business logic and less on the plumbing. Enterprise Library will do the heavy lifting for you!
