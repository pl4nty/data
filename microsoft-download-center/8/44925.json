    "detailsSection": ".NET Remoting is a legacy product that is supported only for backward compatibility.  It is not secure across mixed-trust environments because it cannot maintain the separate trust levels between client and server.  For example, you should never expose a .NET Remoting endpoint to the Internet or to untrusted clients.   We recommend existing Remoting applications be migrated to newer and more secure technologies. If the application\u2019s design uses only Http and is RESTful, we recommend ASP.NET Web API. Learn more at ASP.NET Web API. If the application is based on SOAP or requires non-Http protocols such as TCP, we recommend WCF.  Learn more at Windows Communication Foundation.\r\n\r\nThis article compares the two technologies and provides recommendations for migrating to WCF.\r\n",
