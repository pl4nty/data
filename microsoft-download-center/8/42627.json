    "detailsSection": "The Hyper-V\u00ae server role in Windows Server\u00ae 2012 and Windows Server\u00ae 2012 R2 includes Hyper-V Replica, which provides the ability to perform asynchronous and frequent replication of virtual machines between a primary and replica datacenter. As virtual machines can be quite large and cross datacenter network traffic is constrained, a WAN optimization solution will provide substantial benefits in bandwidth reduction. This whitepaper examines the benefits delivered by Riverbed Steelhead appliances when replication traffic flows over HTTPS using Hyper-V Replica\u2019s certificate based authentication deployment.",
