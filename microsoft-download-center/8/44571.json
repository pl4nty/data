    "detailsSection": "Azure Site Recovery (ASR) enables customers to replicate their virtual machines to Microsoft Azure for business continuity and disaster recovery purposes. Virtual machines tend to be quite large. Consequently, customer\u2019s often send large amounts of replication traffic to Azure based on the guest workload pattern. Sending large amounts of data can severely impact your corporate internet connection and potentially lead to longer recovery point objectives (RPO). To address both these issues, an on premise Riverbed SteelHead WAN appliance was paired with an Azure hosted SteelHead virtual machine to optimize ASR traffic. ASR and the Riverbed SteelHeads work out of the box without minimal configuration & deployment change. This document captures the network optimization delivered by Riverbed SteelHead on the Azure bound replication traffic through ASR. ",
