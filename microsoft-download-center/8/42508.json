Windows Phone 8.1 builds on this standard to create an integrated MDM client that allows MDM system vendors to manage Windows Phone devices. This overview will show you how you can manage Windows Phone 8.1 by using an on premises, off premises, or hybrid MDM solution, such as those that System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager and Windows Intune provide. It also covers the use of MDM solutions in conjunction with Exchange Server, which allow you to not only manage the device and configuration settings, but also protect the email messages users send and receive on their Windows Phone 8.1 devices.",
