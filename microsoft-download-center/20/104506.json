Then, using the credentials provided the script will create a session against Exchange Online, which will be used to manipulate O365 Active Directory objects remotely.\r\n</UL>\r\n\r\n<UL>NOTE - Before running the script, copy the Sync-MailPublicFolders.strings.psd1 file in the same directory as the Sync-MailPublicFolders.ps1 script file.</UL>",
