When you're ready to consume or use the inventory, you take over ownership of the inventory. This document includes information about how to physically receive vendor-owned on\u2011hand inventory without creating general ledger transactions, how to start a production process where the vendor-owned inventory can be physically reserved, and how to change the ownership of the raw material so that you can process the consumption as part of production order processing. There is also some information about how vendors can monitor consumption of their inventory by using the vendor collaboration interface.",
