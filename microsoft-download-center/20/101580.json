It will show an alert on console to delete the SO if they want to delete the category.</li>\r\n<li>End user will still be able to update his other requests even if he is removed as an affected user from one of his requests through Self Service Portal.</li>\r\n<li>Users will be able to scroll properly on all standard forms under work items tab.</li>\r\n<li>Made enhancements to the start-up time of the SDK service.</li>\r\n<li>When a user opens manual activity from any IR/CR and execute custom task, it will execute without any error.</li>\r\n<li>Each Portal Trace log now shows thread ID, Process ID, Date and Time in UTC.</li>\r\n<li>With this fix, Service Manager supports SCCM from 1806 to 2002. However, it is recommended to follow the steps in \u201cAfter the Installation\u201d.</li>\r\n<li>As SQLNCLI is technically out of support, with this update Service Manager now supports MSOLEDBSQL.</li>\r\n</ul>",
