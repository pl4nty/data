In this session, we\u2019ll talk about what these scores mean, how they\u2019re calculated, and how to use them to quickly find and fix the highest-value security configuration issues you may have in your tenant. Anyone with a Secure Score over 80% is excused from attending this session, but the rest of y\u2019all should plan to attend. You know who you are.\r\n\r\nRecording of presentation by Paul Robichaux is at https://youtu.be/KdrZ-hlJTBw.",
