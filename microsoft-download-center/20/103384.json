    "detailsSection": "Ransomware attackers use a variety of techniques to gain access to an organization's network, elevate their privileges, and determine what and where the ransomable assets are located. At an opportune time, they encrypt or destroy them and demand a ransom. An effective strategy for combatting ransomware attacks is to create three levels of prevention and mitigation: keeping them out, preventing them from getting elevated privileges, and protecting your ransomable assets. This poster lays out these three layers and includes implementation checklists so that you can gauge your current prevention and mitigation state and track ongoing progress.",
