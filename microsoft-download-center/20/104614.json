By the start of 2022 we had already disabled it for millions of tenants, but we\u2019re not done yet. This session will give you the inside story on how we are doing it, how it\u2019s going, what we built to help us along the way, where we're going, and for the first time, we will share some details on our progress.\r\n\r\nRecording of presentation by Greg Taylor is at https://youtu.be/Db_OYLXJQF4.",
