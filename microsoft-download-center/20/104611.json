Follow the least privilege principle and don't have your administrative accounts granted persistent high permissions. In this session, we'll discuss how a large company implemented PIM for all Exchange admins and how to create custom roles to allow specific Exchange admins to grant admin consent for a subset of OAuth 2.0 permission scopes.\r\n\r\nRecording of presentation by Ingo Gegenwarth is at https://youtu.be/emIrwPDm1wY.",
