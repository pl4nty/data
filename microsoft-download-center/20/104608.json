With the help of Exchange Online, Defender for Office 365, and Microsoft 365, we deploy the needed security requirements and comply with the law. Even if you are not governed by these laws, implementing these security measures is the best practice. Come learn what they are and how to implement them in your organization.\r\n\r\nRecording of presentation by Petr Vlk is at https://youtu.be/6qQlT3fkZKg.",
