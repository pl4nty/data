We recommend that you use shipping products, if possible, to migrate security information, since permissions in SQL Server can be incredibly complex. DMA does have the ability to transfer security information and does a full dependency graph to ensure permissions are transferred properly \u2013 which this script does not do. This script, on the other hand, gives you the option of doing an Active Directory lookup on users to get the User Principal Name (UPN), which DMA currently does not.",
