We will deal with the current issues in accessibility, as well as the various initiatives, norms, and standards implemented with respect to Web-enabled applications. In this regard, we will examine using Microsoft products and technologies to design and develop Web sites that comply with accessibility guidelines. <br />\nMore specifically, this document describes a set of guidelines that enable you to produce accessible Web sites by using Microsoft Content Management Server 2002 and SharePoint technologies. It defines the extent to which these technologies offer the best possible compliance with, as a minimum, the priority 1 checkpoints of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 1.0.",
