Check a registry key to see if the tool has already run on this device. If found, the EXE will exit.  Otherwise, the EXE will write this key:<br/> HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Office\\ClickToRun\\UpdateSupport\\FC2853FB-9DA8-435D-9B07-A0A9CE876A67<br/>\r\n2. Look for an Office installation on the device. If there are none, the EXE will exit.<br/>\r\n3. Check whether the Office build range is between 16.0.12130.10000 and 16.0.12130.20390. If outside the build range, then the EXE will exit.<br/>\r\n4. If the build is in the required range, the EXE will then stop the ClickToRun system service and copy over the new client files from build 16.0.12130.20410 that is embedded in the tool EXE. Office applications do not need to close down and there will be no impact to end-user productivity. <br/>\r\n5. The EXE then exits, and the device can now resume Office updates.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nLog files are written under %temp%\\&lt;MachineName&gt;-&lt;Timestamp&gt;.log for the elevated user that ran the EXE, containing information about the machine state and what actions were taken.",
