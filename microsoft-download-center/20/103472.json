Azure services include both IaaS and PaaS \r\nofferings which means you can have your SQL Server workloads running in a hosted infrastructure (IaaS) or \r\nin a managed service (PaaS). However, within Azure PaaS, Azure has multiple deployment options and each \r\ndeployment option has multiple service tiers. Purpose of this document is to help you narrow down the \r\noptions and do further due diligence to finalize the target platform for your SQL workload.",
