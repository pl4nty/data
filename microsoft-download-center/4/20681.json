    "detailsSection": "The 2007 Microsoft Office System is a powerful platform for building role based, collaborative, and analytical applications that extend the reach of Line of Business systems and backend applications to information workers across the organization. These Office Business Applications combine the powerful platform capabilities of the Microsoft Office System with the user familiarity of the Office Clients to surface line of business data, information, and processes to information workers directly within the business productivity tools, interfaces, and devices that they use to execute and complete their business tasks.<br />\n<br />\nThe OBA Composition Reference Toolkit brings to surface the underlying composition capabilities of the 2007 Microsoft Office system. It integrates seamlessly with the Microsoft Office 2007 System to enable a prescriptive application composition experience for Information Workers to build and deploy Office Business Applications (OBAs) using semantically related OBA Components like Workflows, SharePoint document libraries and lists, SharePoint Pages, Web Parts, VSTO Office Client Add-ins, BI Reports, BI Dashboards etc. The  toolkit comprises an OBA Composition Server and an OBA Composer. The OBA Composition Server implements metadata and provisioning services to enable cataloging OBA components, defining semantic relationships between components, defining the bindings between components and LOB systems, and to support deploying OBAs composed by users. The OBA Composer is a WPF application that consumes and uses the services of the OBA Composition Server to enable a rich client and prescriptive user experience for composing and deploying OBAs.",
