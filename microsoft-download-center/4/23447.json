After finding that an Oracle-based solution would have cost more than twice as much as a SQL Server 2005 and .NET Framework 2.0-based solution, InvestLink contracted with Microsoft partner twentysix New York to jointly build a solution around the Microsoft Application Platform. This solution was brought to market successfully in 18 months. The new solution boasts better scalability and security, lower ongoing costs, and higher productivity for programmers and users alike.",
