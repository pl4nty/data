For 2009, we also needed to address Windows 7 readiness in time for the holidays. This talk will present a short summary of the existing GFW requirements and call out the changes made for the 1.4.0009 updates. We will also cover Windows 7 app-compat guidance, the related TR changes, and explore the latest technical showcases. As the talks \"The Games for Windows Self-Certification Program\" and \"Games for Windows: Updates for Windows 7\" shared a time-slot, please note that the audio file in this download includes both talks.",
