    "detailsSection": "Learn how you can take advantage of virtualization technologies by reassigning licenses across servers within a server farm. This applies to software licenses for certain server applications and all external connector (EC) licenses. <br/><br/>\r\nIn the past, it was necessary to assign Microsoft server software and EC licenses to a specific server for at least 90 days before reassigning them to another server. With the implementation of new terms for certain products, Microsoft is waiving the 90-day reassignment rule, allowing you to reassign licenses from one server to another within a server farm as frequently as you need to. This allows you to freely move both licenses and running instances within a server farm from one server to another. <br/><br/>\r\nThis brief explains the new terms, lists eligible server licenses, and provides answers to frequently asked questions.",
