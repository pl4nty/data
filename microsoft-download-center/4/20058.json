A total of 6 systems are involved in the mission critical business processes that are to be<br />\noverhauled. Revenu Qu\u00e9bec called upon CGI's Qu\u00e9bec city business unit to undertake this project after being selected through a formal public RFP/proposal process. Providing the proper tools for the design and implementation of theses systems and the means of favoring productivity and consistent work are elements of the strategy to ensure the quality delivery of theses conerstone systems.  This resulted in the creation of the XP Toolbox in the means of providing end-to-end services that automate and guide the software development process so that focus may be put on the business functionality at hand.",
