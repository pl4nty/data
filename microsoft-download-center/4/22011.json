    "detailsSection": "In Remote Desktop Services deployments, application conflicts can lead to silos of remote desktop session host servers. To avoid application conflicts, applications typically must undergo significant testing to determine which applications will collide and, therefore, must be separated and run on different session host silos\u2014a time-consuming and costly process. Separating out multiple remote desktop session hosts to accommodate specific applications routinely results in servers being underutilized because each one is locked into a specific configuration, capable of serving only a limited set of non-conflicting applications. Often, 20 servers are required to support 1,000 users. <br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nMicrosoft Application Virtualization for Remote Desktop Services 4.6 helps consolidate remote desktop session host servers by offering the following features and benefits: \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Reduce app-to-app and multi-user application conflicts and hence the need for regression testing </li>\r\n<li>Accelerate application deployment by reducing the deployment risk </li>\r\n<li>Simplify profile management</li>\r\n<li>App-V for RDS 4.6 now supports 64-bit operating systems.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br/>",
