Has primitives for per pixel and convolution operations and includes 7 working examples illustrating the features of the language: RGB filtering, saturation lightness adjustment, unsharp masking, highlight shadow adjustment, and several others. Quad core i7 desktop machines should achieve up to 1GPixel/sec. for RGB floating point images and modern laptops up to 400MPixels/sec.",
