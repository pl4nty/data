The probablity of selecting the same feature from two documents is (when averaged over all choices of random functions) equal to the Jaccard metric.\r\n\r\nThis package implements shingling, and a specific family of hash functions for converting text documents into sets of features.  Many of the techniques used here, and most applications of this code, are covered by patents owned by Yahoo, which purchased Overture, which purchased Alta Vista, so only investigative use, consistent with applicable patent laws, is to be pursued using this code without negotiation of appropriate licenses.  Nonetheless, we find this to be of great value as a research tool, and release it in that spirit.\r\n\r\nThe HTML parsing included herein is pretty kludgy; I recommend changing it.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1.1 fixes a warning message, and compiles correctly.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1 differs from the 1.0  in that\r\n1) The random number generator is now seeded, badly.\r\n2) The big-endian code is now correct.",
