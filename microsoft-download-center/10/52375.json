Each row in the dataset represents a single context-message-response triple that has been evaluated by crowdsourced annotators as scoring an average of 4 or higher on a 5-point Likert scale measuring quality of the response in the context.  The data has been randomly binned into tuning (development) and test sets, comprising 2118 and 2114 triples respectively.  It is released to the natural language processing community for academic research purposes only.  In order to access the underlying tweets and related metadata, you will need to call the Twitter API.
