    "detailsSection": "From this site, you can download the Microsoft Surface Hub Recovery Tool or the Surface Hub Replacement PC drivers.\r\n\r\nThe Surface Hub Recovery Tool helps you re-image your Surface Hub Solid State Drives (SSD) using a Windows 10 desktop device without a need for calling for support or replacing the SSD itself.  With this tool, you can reimage an SSD that has an unknown Administrator password, boot errors, was unable to complete a cloud recovery, or for a device that has an older version of the OS. The tool will not fix physically damaged SSDs. This download is meant to be used with the <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/surface-hub/surface-hub-recovery-tool\">Surface Hub Admin Guide</A>, which contains further details on using the Surface Hub Recovery Tool.\r\n\r\nThe Surface Hub Replacement PC driver set is available for those customers who have chosen to disable the Surface Hub\u2019s internal PC and use an external computer with their 84\u201d or 55\u201d Surface Hub.
