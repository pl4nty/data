It consists of over 2000 algebra word problems. Each word problem is annotated with the full derivation (template + alignments) of the relevant equations from the word problem. Please refer to the paper for details.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<b>Contents</b>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>1000 new training/testing data with diverse templates and narratives crawled from algebra.com. (DRAW dataset in the paper)</li>\r\n<li>Word problems from <a href=\"http://groups.csail.mit.edu/rbg/code/wordprobs/\">http://groups.csail.mit.edu/rbg/code/wordprobs/</a> annotated using our proposed schema. (Alg-514 in the paper) </li>\r\n<li>Word problems from linear-T2 subset from <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/dolphin/\">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/dolphin/</a> annotated using our proposed schema.
