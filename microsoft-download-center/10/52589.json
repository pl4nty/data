We construct our training snapshot by taking the Freebase snapshot on 3rd September, 2013 and consider entities that have a link to their Wikipedia page. The development and test data consists of facts that were added to the 1st June, 2014 snapshot of Freebase. To get negative data, we make a closed world assumption treating any unobserved instance in Freebase as a negative example. Unobserved instances in the Freebase snapshot on 3rd September, 2013 and 1st June, 2014 are used as negative examples in training and testing respectively.",
