All the Windows Embedded versions we will be discussing in this paper are either fully equivalent or a subset of the functionality that shipped in the desktop version of the OS. Therefore, your current knowledge of Windows XP, Windows 7, or Windows 8/8.1 will continue to be of use.\r\n<br></br>\r\nAn OEM is an individual or company that selects one of the products mentioned in this paper. The OEM customizes and configures a unique software image based on that product. Then the OEM combines that image with hardware to produce a task-specific or industry-specific solution that is sold to customers. The OEM must have a license with Microsoft for each product and pay a run-time license fee for each device sold to its customers. \r\n",
