This release contains sources for the SkipNet overlay network and two other technologies built using it: the Overlook distributed name service, and the FUSE lightweight distributed failure notification system, plus applications exercising them. The SkipNet code and applications can be run in one of two environments: a simulation environment, in which all nodes run within a single program communicate via a simulated network topology, and a live or \"cluster\" environment, in which each node runs as a separate program and communicates with other nodes via TCP connections.
