Comega had a simple, declarative, and powerful model of concurrency\u2014Join Patterns\u2014applicable both to multithreaded applications and to the orchestration of asynchronous, event-based distributed applications. By exploiting Generics in the Common Language Runtime, we can provide join patterns as a library rather than as a language feature. Offering a library has advantages: The library is language neutral, supporting C#, Visual Basic, and other languages; and the library's join patterns are dynamic, supporting solutions difficult to express with the static join patterns of Comega. The Joins library is efficient and has a simple interface that makes it easy to translate Comega programs to C#. The installer includes a tutorial, documentation, samples, and demos.",
