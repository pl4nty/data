Given a graph, such as a road network, the students are expected to devise landmark placement that gives good bounds for distance estimation using the landmarks and triangle inequality. We provide a complete solution using random landmark generation and a function to evaluate a set of landmarks. The students\u2019 goal is to replace random landmark generation with their own that gets as high an evaluation score as possible.",
