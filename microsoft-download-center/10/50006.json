    "detailsSection": "With the introduction of the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book, a new Surface Dock is now available and the current Surface Pro 3 Docking Station will be discontinued as the new Surface Dock is also compatible with Surface Pro 3. \r\nIf you decide that you don\u2019t want to purchase the new Surface Dock, but instead use your existing Surface Pro 3 Docking Station with your new Surface Pro 4 (which has changed dimensions), we have made available an adapter that attaches to your Surface Pro 3 Docking Station so your Surface Pro 4 can snugly hold your new Surface Pro 4. You can get this adapter at no charge (plus shipping and handling) through Microsoft\u2019s Customer Support or through your commercial reseller. \r\nHowever, if you don\u2019t want to wait for this to be shipped to you or you want to avoid the shipping and handling, you can print out your own adapter with a 3D printer. See downloads page for instructions and schematics. \r\nPlease note that the quality of the 3D printing will depend on the printer used to make these and your 3D printer must be able to accommodate a build volume of 10.3mm x 100.8mm x 285.4 mm. \r\nThe Surface Pro 3 Docking Station Adapter schematics is available in two different file formats, .STP and .STL. Please choose the format best suited for your 3D printer. \r\nPlease note that these instructions are for informational purposes only.  MICROSOFT MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IN THIS SUMMARY.\r\n",
