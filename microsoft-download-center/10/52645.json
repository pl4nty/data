In our research, we carried out extensive user studies using Amazon Mechanical Turk as part of which we measured the adoption and changes in opinions of the participants on a variety of topics such as car and soda brands, green energy, organic food etc. The experiments comprised of the following steps - 1. Ask the user to give her innate (starting) opinion on a given topic. 2. Show her a set of opinions of other users participating in the experiment. 3. Ask her for her opinion on the topic again. These are anonymized users and number around 200.",
