The WebQuestionsSP dataset contains full semantic parses in SPARQL queries for 4,737 questions, and \u201cpartial\u201d annotations for the remaining 1,073 questions for which a valid parse could not be formulated or where the question itself is bad or needs a descriptive answer. This release also includes an evaluation script and the output of the STAGG semantic parsing system when trained using the full semantic parses. More detail can be found in the document and labeling instructions included in this release, as well as the paper.",
