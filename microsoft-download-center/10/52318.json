These annotations additionally specify information about the precise nature of the match, such as whether the linguistic forms of the question and the answer are similar. The annotation data has been split in two different ways to facilitate different algorithm-training methodologies: 1) 10 files, each containing 10 percent of the original 1.4K questions, along with the full set of answers for each question, and 2) 10 files, each containing 10 percent of the full, pooled set of 10K+ question/answer pairs.",
