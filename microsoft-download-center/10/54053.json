This scheme provides approximately 128 bits of quantum security and 192 bits of classical security.",

The last two offer hybrid ciphersuites that are as above, except the key exchange \r\nincludes both SIDH and ECDH key exchange; the pre-master secret is the concatenation of the ECDH shared secret and the SIDH shared secret. All these ciphersuites require TLSv1.2 because \r\nof the use of AES-GCM.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n----------\r\n\r\n[1] Craig Costello, Patrick Longa, and Michael Naehrig (Microsoft Research). \"Efficient algorithms for supersingular isogeny Diffe-Hellman.\" https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/413.pdf.\r\n[2] http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/sidh/\r\n[3] https://openssl.org/source/old/1.0.2/openssl-1.0.2g.tar.gz",
