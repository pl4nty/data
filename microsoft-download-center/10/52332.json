This is not a simulator for any specific SSD, but rather a simulator for an idealized SSD that is parameterized by the properties of NAND flash chips such as read, write, erase latency, number of chips, connectivity, and chip bandwidth. DiskSim is primarily a trace-driven simulator, but it has some functionality for generating random workloads.  This add-on is delivered as a source subdirectory of DiskSim, along with a patch file to modify an existing DiskSim source tree to be compatible with the add-on.",
