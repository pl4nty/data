IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, Vol.51, (no.4), pp.1020\u201333, 2003. As mentioned in the publication, it displays solid robustness against traditional signal processing, including arbitrary limited pitch bending and time-scaling. However, targetted procedures such as watermark estimation or the replacement attack can wipe out the watermark while preserving perceptual fidelity. Authors: Darko Kirovski and Rico Malvar, both at Microsoft Research.",
