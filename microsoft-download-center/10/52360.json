The Generic Worker framework enables multiple .NET methods and dependency libraries to be registered as applications and dynamically downloaded into a virtual machine on demand when a request to run an application is received. The Generic Worker framework provides a command-line client, .NET APIs, and a Trident workflow activity to invoke any registered application, with support for automatic transfer of simple parameters and files between desktop and the virtual machine.",
