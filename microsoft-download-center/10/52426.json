When you drag a window into the periphery, it becomes smaller and continues to get smaller the closer you get to the edge of the screen. This makes it possible to keep windows open all the time, and change \"minimize\" to mean \"return to the periphery\". Groups of windows can easily be created to represent different user tasks. Switching between groups is done simply by clicking on the task marker flag.",
