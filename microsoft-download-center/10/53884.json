Microsoft SharePoint and OneDrive for Business are covered by the core tenets of earning and maintaining trust: security, privacy, compliance, and transparency. With SharePoint and OneDrive, they\u2019re your files. You own them and control them.  \r\n\r\nThe Microsoft approach to securing your files involves:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>A set of customer-managed tools that adapt to your organization and its security needs.</li>  \r\n<li>A Microsoft-built security control framework of technologies, operational procedures, and policies that meet the latest global standards and can quickly adapt to security trends and industry-specific needs.</li>\r\n</ol> \r\n\r\nThese tools and processes apply to all Microsoft Office 365 services\u2014including SharePoint and OneDrive\u2014so all your content beyond files is secure.
