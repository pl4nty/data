A paper describing this work was presented during SIGGRAPH 2008. The released code implements the \"embedding\" stage, in which point tracks are embedded into 2-D, directly yielding x and y coordinates for each track. We assume that these tracks are given.  Such tracks can be computed using standard computer-vision algorithms for interest-point detection and tracking. The code is written in MATLAB.",
