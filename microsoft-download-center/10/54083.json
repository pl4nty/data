They can create monitors and rules for device components such as Processor, Memory, Fan, Temperature Sensor, Power Supply, Voltage Sensor and Custom device components. </li>\r\n<li> Users can define monitors and rules for multiple devices in a single project file and generate a single Management Pack for all those devices. </li>\r\n<li> NetMonMPGenerator.exe is a command line tool for users who wish to generate MP through command line. Users would need to provide an input XML to the command line tool to generate custom MP. The input XML would have all the device information and workflows (monitors and rules) defined on the device.  </li>\r\n</ul>",
