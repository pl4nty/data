It also preserves branch lengths that indicate the genetic similarity between two species. PhyloDet is interactive, enabling users to set any node of the tree as the root and to show or hide any branches without re-layout of the tree. PhyloDet enables biologists to visualize complex interactions and how they relate to the evolutionary history of the species.",
