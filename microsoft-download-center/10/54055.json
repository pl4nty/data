    "downloadDescription": "This release contains a patch for OpenSSL 1.0.2g to support Peikert's Ring Learning With Errors (RLWE) key exchange [1], using the instantiation of Alkim, Ducas, P\u00f6ppelmann and Schwabe [2], and the improvements and implementation of Microsoft Research [3]. The OpenSSL integration follows the one of Bos, Costello, Naehrig, Stebila; we refer to their paper [4] for more details.",

    "detailsSection": "The library specifies four ciphersuites\r\n* RLWE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256\r\n* RLWE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256\r\n* RLWE-ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256\r\n* RLWE-ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256\r\n\r\nThe first two consist of a RLWE key exchange, as described in [4], authentication based on ECDSA or RSA digital signatures, authenticated encryption (with associated data) (AEAD) based on AES-128 in GCM (Galois Counter Mode); and key derivation and hashing based on SHA-256. The last two offer hybrid ciphersuites that are as above, except the key exchange includes both RLWE and ECDH key exchange; the pre-master secret is the concatenation of the ECDH shared secret and the RLWE shared secret. All these ciphersuites require TLSv1.2 because of the use of AES-GCM.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n----------\r\n\r\n[1] C.
