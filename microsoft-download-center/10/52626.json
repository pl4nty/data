The package provides approximately 5.5 million document identifiers of a subset of the ClueWeb\u201909 \u201cCategory A English\u201d documents that are likely to be from news sources. The package also contains two sets of human generated labels.  The first set of labels is the assessment of 456 pairs of documents by the authors as near-duplicate, non-duplicate, containment, near-duplicate irrelevant, or non-duplicate irrelevant.    The second set of labels is 710 labels obtained via a crowdsourcing system where the pairs of articles are labeled as near-duplicate or non-duplicate articles.  Finally, the data release contains the experimental design templates used for the crowdsourced assessments.",
