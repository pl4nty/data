    "detailsSection": "R is the world\u2019s most powerful programming language for statistical computing, machine learning, and graphics, with a thriving global community of users, developers, and contributors. Microsoft R Open is provided by Microsoft to support R development using Revolution R Enterprise for scalable, distributed R solutions. <br />\r\n\r\nThis download contains the installer for the current release of Microsoft R Open for 64-bit Windows (MRO-3.2.2-for-RRE-8.0.1). When you install Microsoft R Open, you can easily build R packages using your own custom code, or use additional packages that you download from CRAN. <br /> \r\nMicrosoft R Open is a prerequisite for installing Revolution R Enterprise 8.0. Although the enterprise tools are not required for basic R package development, Revolution R Enterprise lets you create R packages that can use parallel processing and run in a scalable environment. \r\nYou can use Microsoft R Open and Revolution R Enterprise to connect to an instance of SQL Server 2016 that has enabled the Advanced Analytic Extensions, and execute your R packages in SQL Server. This provides far greater memory for your R solutions as well as the convenience of in-database analytics. <b>You can also use Microsoft R Open to develop solutions that run in Microsoft R Server.</b>\r\n",
