    "detailsSection": "Software Transactional Memory (STM) is an API for multithreaded computation in which shared data is synchronized without using locks. Threads synchronize by means of memory transactions, short-lived computations that either commit (take effect) or abort (have no effect). Transactions avoid the well-known problems of locking, including deadlock, priority inversion, and fault-intolerance. The SXM is a software transactional memory package written in C#. It is much easier to use than prior STMs because it uses Reflection.Emit to transparently add synchronization code to sequential data structures.",
