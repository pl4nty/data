These generic constructs take types as parameters, and are primarily intended to better support typed containers such as lists, stacks, and dictionaries. Microsoft's research work on generics is an ongoing project. This release is intended to allow you to familiarise yourself with the current state of the research, and to provide feedback where appropriate. Certain aspects of the design of generics for the SSCLI will change in future releases.",
