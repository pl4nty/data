We use the DirectX compute shader to provide partial subdivision of a control mesh on a GPU. This subdivision occurs only where necessary to generate Bicubic B-Spline patches. These patches then are sent to the hardware tessellator for evaluation and rendering. The resulting surface corresponds exactly to the true Catmull-Clark limit surfaces at triangle vertices, up to machine precision. Furthermore, we are able to render meshes with tagged, semi-sharp edges, as well as hierarchical edits.",
