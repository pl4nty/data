It will also copy most schema and schema objects as well as users and many of the permissions. Parallel copy can be between tables and either using physical partitions or logical partitions to copy a table in parallel. Indexes can be created before or after the copy operation, the same with foreign keys (tables can be copied in dependency order to allow FKs to be left in place).",
