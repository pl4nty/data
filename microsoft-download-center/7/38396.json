Alternately, you can install the RMS Client on client computers using the GUI-based interactive setup provided by the RMS Client Installation Wizard. To launch this type of installation you need only double-click on the RMS Client installer package (Setup.msi) in the folder to which it was copied or downloaded on your local computer.\r\n<br/>\r\nAD RMS Client 2.1 installation package will upgrade RMS Client 2.0 if AD RMS Client 2.0 was already installed on the machine.",
