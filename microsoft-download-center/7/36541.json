These changes are driven primarily by the switch from a single credit card processor that uses a proprietary interface in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, to support for multiple credit card processors that are based on a published interface in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2. Support for multiple credit card processors is a benefit of using the Payment SDK. ",
