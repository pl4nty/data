This includes the following areas: \r\n<UL><LI>Issue cost will not be adjusted by running an inventory close with the moving average method since this is a pure perpetual model.</LI>\r\n<LI>Price differences between the point of product receipt and the invoice can be proportionally expensed.</LI>\r\n<LI>The handling of negative inventory, backdating of inventory transactions, adjustment of inventory values and posting of credit notes with Moving average.</LI>\r\n<LI>How costing of production is supported by Moving average.</LI></UL>",
