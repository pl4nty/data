The Microsoft Visio Compatibility Pack opens drawings in the newer file format when used together with the Microsoft Visio 2010 SP2 update.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nViewing Visio drawings is as simple as double-clicking the drawing file in Windows Explorer, or opening the file directly in Visio 2010. The newer file format is converted to a file format supported by Visio 2010 (a file with a .vsd or .vdx extension). You can then edit the converted drawing, or save it to any format supported by your version of Visio. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe conversion process may modify diagram formatting, such as theming and shape formatting. A notification appears at the top of a converted drawing, telling you whether any such changes were made during conversion. If so, click <b>Details</b> to see a list of drawing formatting that was changed. If you have the Microsoft Visio 2013 Viewer installed, you can also click on <b>View Original</b> to view the original file.",
