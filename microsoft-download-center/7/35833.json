Otherwise, all data connectivity between Retail POS and Microsoft Dynamics AX was stopped, and any sales transactions processed in Retail POS after the start of the Microsoft Dynamics AX upgrade had to be manually imported for posting. Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 introduces new functionality that lets a previous version of POS (Microsoft Dynamics AX for Retail 2009 R2 Refresh or Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack POS) communicate with Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 after the upgrade.
