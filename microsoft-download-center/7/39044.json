    "detailsSection": "As Microsoft Dynamics CRM continues pushing towards the enterprise space, it becomes increasingly important to support the requirements of the enterprise\u2014not only through the product but also in terms of functionality, scale, resilience, and security. From an implementation perspective, enterprises expect to be able to have structured, repeatable processes that are predictable and well documented to manage their application lifecycle. To date, a number of approaches have been articulated through various channels and from a variety of sources, but a definitive and full lifecycle approach has not been concisely communicated by Microsoft. Many customers, partners, and consultants within MCS are reaching out for best practice advice and guidance, and it is Microsoft\u2019s responsibility to deliver on this expectation. This document focuses on providing a coherent end-to-end approach to enterprise development for Dynamics CRM.",
