Normally, you would populate the shared folder by running the Save-Help cmdlet from a computer that both has access to the Internet, and has the required feature or server role installed.  \r\n\r\nHowever, in some environments with strict network restrictions, finding a computer that meets both requirements can be difficult. As an alternative, you can download the Help files manually, and copy them to an shared folder on your network, or a local folder that the restricted computers can access.\r\n",
