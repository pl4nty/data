    "detailsSection": "With the ambient credo to \u201cdo more with  less, with a better agility and time to market\u201d, IT inevitably becomes a  service provider for its enterprise and need to run like a business. The  undertaking also requires a step further in the way the IT delivers its  services to its customers: internal businesses and beyond. IT has indeed to  deliver the services in an industrialized way for greater speed and lower cost.  This requires increasing their overall core infrastructure operational maturity  in two main areas.<br/>\r\n  <br/>\r\n  The first one aims at improving the  management of their own on-premises IT landscape and traditional services by  evolving towards a private cloud, i.e. an optimized and more automated way to  provision and operate (a catalog of) services for businesses. The second one  consists in enhancing their service offerings by utilizing off-premises public  cloud augmentations (for acceptable cases of use) as (lower-cost) add-ons to  existing services in the catalog.<br/>\r\n  <br/>\r\n  The combination and interaction of these  two cloud paradigms results in the emergence of the hybrid cloud which meets  the demands and the expectations of the business. Hybrid cloud spans the two  above implementations. A service request can be instantiated in either  implementation, or moved from one to another, or can horizontally grow between  the two implementations (cloud bursting for instance).<br/>\r\n  <br/>\r\n  This paper discusses how Microsoft can  help your organization achieve a successful hybrid cloud strategy and present  the enabling technologies from on-premises, cross-premises, and off-premises  implementation of (parts of) the services. Several typical patterns and common  scenarios are illustrated throughout this paper.\r\n",
