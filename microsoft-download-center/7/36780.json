In Accounts receivable in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, payments can be received from customers electronically or through an external cashiering system. The customer payment journal service (LedgerCustPaymJournalService) provides operations to accept external payments and create the required journals and journal lines. The payments are then matched against open transactions and settled automatically based on a system-defined settlement priority. The customer journal payment service can be used in conjunction with the customer transaction service to find a customer and the customer\u2019s open transactions. ",
