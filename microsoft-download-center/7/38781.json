This paper introduces problem management and the benefits organizations may derive from implementing a robust problem management framework. It frames problem management by comparing it to incident management and describes the difference between the two. It also provides several foundational concepts of effective problem management processes, and discusses examples of how these types of organizations might implement problem management, including root cause analysis, to help improve the reliability of their online services.",
