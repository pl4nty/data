This PowerPoint deck is used to present the Microsoft enterprise platform value and to seek permission to form a Solution Implementation team to pursue solution design and architecture. This deck needs to be customized to reflect (or at least indicate) the BDM\u2019s priorities. The TDM Conversation Sheet can be used as an illustration during this discussion.",
