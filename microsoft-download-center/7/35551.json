The Sales team can use this document in two ways: to prepare a discussion with the BDM about relevant pain points, and to guide the BDM through potential solution features and functionality. These discussions are essential for capturing the relevance and priority of business imperatives and the compelling ideas for a solution scope. The BDM Solution Briefing Deck is a useful tool to introduce and structure this discussion.",
