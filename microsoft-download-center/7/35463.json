In addition to text conversations, UCMA 4.0 supports speech-technology enabled voice conversations and collaboration. UCMA 4.0 supports the development of server side, middle-tier applications targeting Microsoft Lync 2013 and Microsoft Lync Server 2013. UCMA 4.0 contains a SIP stack, a media stack, and speech engines for both automatic speech recognition (ASR) as well as speech synthesis (TTS). \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nUCMA 4.0 can be used to add communications capabilities to your business software and processes and can be used to create outbound applications such as alerts or notifications and surveys, inbound speech-technology enabled interactive voice response applications, and automated agents known as query-response bots. UCMA 4.0 API provides access to Lync Server 2013 presence information and can be used to build role agents that use Enhanced Presence information to streamline communications between people. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nAdvanced UCMA 4.0 scenarios can be used to develop various applications: \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Automated Call Distributors that perform skill-based routing.</li>\r\n<li>Call recording.</li>\r\n<li>Conferencing services such as conference access control.</li>\r\n<li>Custom client gateways that interface with, for example, other communications networks, Interactive Voice Response platforms, and speech servers using the Microsoft ASR and TTS engines.</li>\r\n</ul>",
