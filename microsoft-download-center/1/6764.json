Specifically, this addresses workloads that conform to the service-oriented architecture (SOA) model of execution and use the SOA programming model for distributed computation.\r\nThis paper describes how to add cache hosts to your HPC cluster and includes code samples of SOA clients and services that work with cached data. This paper also provides performance data that you can use as a guideline for setting up and monitoring cache hosts and developing custom applications.\r\n",
