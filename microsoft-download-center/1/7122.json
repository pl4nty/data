It provides a central place for your training efforts, and includes training content from Microsoft\u2019s core products. Microsoft also provides ongoing and updated content packs.   <br /><br />\r\n\r\nThe Hub uses SharePoint Server\u2019s social networking capabilities, such as blogs and discussion groups. In addition, it offers the Coach program, a change management feature to help you train end users to self-help, reducing the burden on your training and IT staff. The Coach program impacts productivity in a collaborative and positive way. <br /><br />\r\n\r\nThe 2010 version of the Productivity Hub includes a quiz feature, a section called \u2018Get it Done\u2019 that offers training for tasks such as email management and collaboration, and also features Silverlight. However, instructions are also provided to use non-Silverlight web parts, if needed. <br /><br />\r\n\r\nWhat the Productivity Hub is:<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Format: Pre-loaded SharePoint site collection, optimized for Web 2.0 functionality and easily deployed within SharePoint Server 2007 or SharePoint 2010 environment, depending on version</li>\r\n<li>Content: Convenient end user productivity training in a variety of formats \r\n(documents, videos, podcasts, etc.).  Receive free quarterly updates of content that you will learn about through the Productivity blog.</li>\r\n<li>Blog: The Productivity blog offers tips and tricks for end user productivity. Use it as is, or your training staff can use the posts as their own to help them get started in running an internal blog.</li>\r\n<li>Train the trainer: Includes IT/Manager section to aid with deployment of the site collection, and guidance to develop the Coach program</li>\r\n<li>Products: Office (2007 & 2010), SharePoint (2007 & 2010), Windows 7, Internet Explorer 9, Project (2007 & 2010), Visio (2007 & 2010), Publisher (2007 & 2010), Live Meeting 2007, Communicator 2007, Groove 2007 and Lync 2010</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\nYou can also download additional content packages that expand the training materials you can make available through the Hub.",

The package also includes materials for five new products -- Live Meeting, OneNote, Project, Publisher, and Visio -- as well as additional content for Access, Communicator, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, SharePoint, and Word.
