While computer science and software development are established disciplines in business and education, software security remains something of an afterthought. There seems to be an ongoing misconception that good software security is not compatible with tight schedules and cutting-edge functionality. This paper discusses why a commitment to software security training is a key tenet of the Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) and vital to ensuring that secure software can take its place as a top priority along with software features and delivery timelines. It also introduces some of the training resources that Microsoft makes available to the ecosystem.",
