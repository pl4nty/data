The ways in which you physically deploy the FIM components (topology), as well as the hardware on which those components run, are important factors in determining the performance and capacity that you can expect from your FIM deployment. The number and complexity of the FIM policy configuration objects may be less obvious, but they are still significant factors to consider when planning for capacity. Finally, the expected scale of the deployment, as well as the load that is expected to be placed on it, are typically more obvious factors that affect performance and capacity",
