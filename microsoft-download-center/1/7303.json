Scenario Summary: Teachers are under increasing pressure to improve student performance while engaging parents and making activities within the classroom transparent. Unfortunately, school districts are struggling with swelling student-to-teacher ratios, disengaged parents, and increased performance reporting requirements. A K-12 classroom collaboration for students, teachers, and parents solution based on the Microsoft Office System enables teachers to give parents access to curriculum and assignments, enables peer-to-peer collaboration with teacher and parent involvement, and helps parents engage in the educational process within and outside of the classroom.",
