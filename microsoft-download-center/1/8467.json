    "detailsSection": "Identity Management for UNIX -> Password Synchronization for Windows Server codenamed Longhorn Server Beta 2 / Windows Server codenamed Longhorn Server IDS_C helps integrate Windows and UNIX networks by simplifying the process of maintaining secure passwords in both environments. Users are freed of the difficulty of maintaining separate passwords for their Windows and UNIX accounts or having to remember to change the password wherever it is used. With Password Synchronization, whenever a user's password is changed on a Windows-based computer or domain, the password can also be automatically changed on every UNIX host for which the user has an account. Password Synchronization can also be configured to change the user's Windows password when the user's UNIX password is changed.<br />\n<br />\nWhen Password Synchronization is configured for Windows-to-UNIX synchronization and a password is changed on a Windows-based computer running Password Synchronization, the Password Synchronization service determines whether the user's password is to be synchronized on UNIX computers. If it is, the service encrypts the password and sends it to the Password Synchronization daemon on each computer with which the Windows-based computer is configured to be synchronized. The ssod daemon then decrypts the password and changes the password on the UNIX host. If the UNIX host is an NIS master server and it is configured to do so, the daemon also runs make to propagate the password change throughout the NIS domain.<br />\n<br />\nWhen Password Synchronization is configured for UNIX-to-WINDOWS synchronization, passwords that are changed on UNIX hosts are synchronized on Windows-based computers and domains. The Password Synchronization PAM module makes this possible by intercepting the password change request on the UNIX host, encrypting the password, and then sending the password change request to the Password Synchronization service running on the Windows-based computers with which it is configured to be synchronized.",
