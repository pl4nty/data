`@microsoft/azureportal-test` is an end-to-end test framework that runs tests against the Microsoft Azure Portal interacting with it as a user would.

#### Goals

- Strive for zero breaking changes to partner team CI
- Develop tests in the same language as the extension
- Focus on partner needs rather than internal portal needs
- Distributed independently from the SDK
- Uses an open source contribution model
- Performant
- Robust
- Great Docs

#### General Architecture

3 layers of abstraction (note the names may change but the general idea should be the same). There may also be some future refactoring to easily differentiate between the layers.

- Test layer

  - Useful wrappers for testing common functionality. Will retry if necessary. Throws if the test/verification fails.
  - Should be used in writing tests
  - Built upon the action and control layers
  - EG: parts.canPinAllBladeParts

- Action layer

  - Performs an action and verifies it was successful. Will retry if necessary.
  - Should be used in writing tests
  - Built upon the controls layer
  - EG: portal.openBrowseBlade

- Controls layer

  - The basic controls used in the portal (eg blades, checkboxes, textboxes, etc). Little to no retry logic. Should be used mainly for composing the actions and tests layers.
  - Should be used for writing test and action layers. Should not be used directly by tests in most cases.
  - Built upon webdriver primitives
  - EG: part, checkbox, etc
