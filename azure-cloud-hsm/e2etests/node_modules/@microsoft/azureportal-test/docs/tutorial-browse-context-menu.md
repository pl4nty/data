#### How to test the context menu in browse shows your extensions commands?

There is a simple abstraction available in MsPortalFx.Tests.Browse. You can use it as follows:

```ts
//1. import test fx
import * as testFx from '@microsoft/azureportal-test';

...

it("Can Use Context Click On Browse Grid Rows", () => {
    ...
//2. Setup an array of commands that are expected to be present in the context menu
//  and call the contextMenuContainsExpectedCommands on Tests.Browse.
    //  The method will assert expectedCommands match what was displayed
