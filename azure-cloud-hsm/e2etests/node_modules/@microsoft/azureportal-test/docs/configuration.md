### Configuration options

This document will describe the behavior and list common configuration settings used by the `@microsoft/azureportal-test` framework.

#### Behavior

The test framework will search for a config.json in the current working directory (usually the directory the test is invoked from). If no config.json is found then it will check the parent folder for a config.json (and so on...).

#### PortalContext

This file contains a list of configuration values used by the test framework for context when running tests against the portal.
These values are mutable to allow test writers to set the values in cases where they prefer not to store them in the config.json.
**We strongly recommend that passwords should not be stored in the config.json file.**

```ts
{"gitdown": "include", "file": "../src/PortalContext.ts"}
```

#### Running tests against the Dogfood environment

In order to run tests against the Dogfood test environment, you will need to update the follow configuration settings in the config.json:

```json
{
  portalUrl: https://df.onecloud.azure-test.net/,
  signInUrl: https://login.windows-ppe.net/
}
```
