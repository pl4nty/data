#### Overview

Automated accessibility testing is enabled via './src/Accessibility.ts' which wraps two NPM libraries, 'axe-core', '@axe-core/playwright' and 'axe-webdriverjs'.

1. 'axe-core' is an accessibility testing library owned by "Deque Systems", see: <https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core>.
1. '@axe-core/playwright' is a wrapper for 'axe-core' which simplifies the process of injecting axe-core code into the DOM when using playwright, see: <https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core-npm/tree/develop/packages/playwright>.
1. 'axe-webdriverjs' is a wrapper for 'axe-core' which simplifies the process of injecting axe-core code into the DOM when using selenium, see: <https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-webdriverjs>.
1. In an effort to make accessibility testing as easy as possible, 'axe-webdriverjs' functionality was further wrapped by a function within 'Accessibility.ts' so that it can be executed with as little code as possible, and results can be surfaced as test failures. For microsoft tenants only: writing a pass/fail result to extension analyzer can be done by setting the optional parameter 'reportTestResult' to 'true'. For an example, see: <https://extensionanalyzer.azure-test.net/extensions/Microsoft_Azure_Storage#blades>, 'Accessibility (axe-core)' column.
1. The function 'ensureAccessibilityIsAxeCoreClean' within './src/Accessibility.ts' is exposed as a public function by the PortalElement class within './src/PortalElement.ts', so any portal element can be tested for accessibilty compliance.
1. The 'ensureAccessibilityIsAxeCoreClean' function is primarily intended to be used at the blade level, as script is executed to collect the extension and blade name for reporting purposes.
1. In the case of blades which have controls which are dynamically rendered (create blades with tabs for example), the 'ensureAccessibilityIsAxeCoreClean' function can be called multiple times, and results can be differentiated by specifying a 'stepName' parameter, additional details below.

#### Sample Test

Here is the minimal amount of code necessary to test if a blade is accessible or not, from './test/AccessibilityTests.ts':

```ts
{"gitdown": "include-section", "file": "../test/AccessibilityTests.ts", "section": "accessibility-test#sample"}

```

This code is opening the browse resource groups blade, and testing if it is accessible. The 'disableRuleIds' parameter is used to ignore a set of errors by their error ID.
