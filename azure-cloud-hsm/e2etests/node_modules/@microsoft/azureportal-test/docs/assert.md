#### Improved assert statements

It is recommended to use `azureportal-test`'s assert statements, especially when asserting elements' properties. All of the assert statements (except for `assert.fail()`) run within the specified timeout in case the assert is failing at first. To make sure that an assert is executed properly, pass an asynchronous callback executes and returns a value that needs to be checked. Here is an example of usage of `assert.strictEqual`:

```ts
{"gitdown": "include-section", "file": "../test/BrowseResourceBladeTests.ts", "section": "assert#strictEqualExample"}
```
