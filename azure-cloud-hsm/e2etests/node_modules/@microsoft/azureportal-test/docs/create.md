#### Opening the create blade from a deployed gallery package

To open/navigate to the create blade a gallery package previously deployed to the Azure Marketplace you can use `portal.openGalleryCreateBlade`. The returned promise will resolve with the CreateBlade defined by that gallery package.

```ts
import * as testFx from '@microsoft/azureportal-test';
...
{"gitdown": "include-section", "file": "../../StbPortal/AcceptanceTests/OneStbTestsTS/ProdCreateLauncherTests.ts", "section": "create#openGalleryCreateBlade"}
...
```

#### Validation State

#### Get the validation state of fields on your create form

`FormElement` exposes two useful functions for working with the ValidationState of controls.

The function `getValidationState` returns a promise that resolves with the current state of the control and can be used as follows

```ts
import * as testFx from '@microsoft/azureportal-test';
...
{"gitdown": "include-section", "file": "../test/Blades/CreateEngineBlade.ts", "section": "create#getValidationState"}
...

```

#### Wait on a fields validation state

The function `waitOnValidationState(someState, optionalTimeout)` returns a promise that resolves when the current state of the control is equivalent to someState supplied. This is particularly useful for scenarions where you may be performing serverside validation and the control remains in a pending state for the duration of the network IO.

```ts
import * as testFx from '@microsoft/azureportal-test';
...
{"gitdown": "include-section", "file": "../test/Blades/CreateEngineBlade.ts", "section": "create#waitOnValidationState"}
...

```
