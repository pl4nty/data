#
# Overview
# 
# This file describes the repository registration in Product Catalog and 
# Service Tree, where services in Service Tree appear as Products in Product 
# Catalog. Any manual changes to repository registration in Product Catalog
# will be overwritten by the information in this file.
# 

#
# Syntax
#
# This file should be valid YAML. There are two expected fields, "Services" and
# "Classification".
# 
# "Services" indicates to which Service Tree entry the repository 
# belongs. If a repository belongs to multiple Service Tree entries, then the 
# value should be a YAML array such as ["product 1", "product 2"]
# 
# Classification indicates whether the repository is Production or Non-Production.
# Production means that the loss of the repository would cause some kind of work
# stoppage, so most repositories should be classified as Production. This field
# should only contain one value, regardless of the number of associated Service
# Tree entries. 
#
