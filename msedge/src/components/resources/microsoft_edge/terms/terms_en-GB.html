Send a Notice of Dispute before arbitration
</span></h3><span>
.

The Notice of Dispute form is available at
</span><span><a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245499">
https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245499</a></span>.
<span>
Complete that form in full, with all the information it requires. We’ll do the same if we have a dispute with you. This Notice of Dispute is a prerequisite to initiating any arbitration. Any applicable statute of limitations will be tolled from the date of a properly submitted individualised Notice of Dispute through the first date on which an arbitration may properly be filed under this Section 2.14.

Small claims court option
</span></h3><span>
. Instead of sending a Notice of Dispute, either you or we may sue the other party in small claims court seeking only individualised relief, so long as the action meets the small claims court’s requirements and remains an individual action seeking individualised relief. The small claims court must be in your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business).

. The AAA will conduct any arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (or if you are an individual and use the Software for personal or household use, or if the value of the dispute is less than $75,000 USD whether or not you are an individual or how you use the Software, its Consumer Arbitration Rules). The AAA’s Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules, as modified by this Section 2.14, will apply in Related Cases (discussed below). For more information, see

<span class="bold_style">
This agreement governs to the extent it conflicts with any applicable AAA rules.
</span><span>
To initiate an arbitration, submit the Demand for Arbitration form available at
</span><span><a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245497">
https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245497</a></span><span>
to the AAA and post a copy to us. The form must contain information that is specific to you and your claim. In a dispute involving $25,000 USD or less, any hearing will be telephonic or by videoconference unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead. Any in-person hearing will take place in your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business). The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could.
</span><span class="bold_style">
The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you individually to satisfy your individual claim, but not relief that would affect non-parties.
</span><p class="preamble_style"><span>
The arbitrator rules on all issues except that a court has exclusive authority: (i) to decide arbitrability, as well as formation, existence, scope, validity and enforceability of this arbitration agreement; (ii) to decide whether the parties have complied with the pre-arbitration requirements (including the individualised Notice of Dispute and Demand for Arbitration forms); (iii) to enforce the prohibition on class, representative, private attorney-general, or combined actions or proceedings, or public injunctive relief; and (iv) to enjoin an arbitration from proceeding if it does not comply with this agreement.
</span></p><p class="preamble_style"><span>
If your Notice of Dispute involves claims similar to those of at least 24 other customers, and if you and those other customers are represented by the same lawyers, or by lawyers who are coordinating with each other, you and we agree that these claims will be “Related Cases”. You and we agree that the AAA’s Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules in effect when the Demand for Arbitration is filed, as modified by this Section 2.14, will apply to Related Cases. Related Cases may only be filed in batches of up to 50 individual arbitrations at a time, and those individual arbitrations will be resolved in the following manner: (i) for the first batch, each side may select up to 25 of these Related Cases to be filed and resolved in individual arbitrations under this Section 2.14; (ii) none of the other Related Cases may be filed or prosecuted in arbitration until the first batch of up to 50 individual arbitrations is resolved; and (iii) if, after that first batch, the parties are unable to informally resolve the remaining Related Cases, a second batch of Related Cases may be filed, where each side may select up to 25 of the Related Cases to be resolved in individual arbitrations under this Section 2.14. This process of batched individual arbitrations will continue until the parties resolve all Related Cases informally or through individual arbitrations. A court has exclusive authority to enforce this paragraph, including whether it applies to a given set of claims, and to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations that do not comply with this paragraph.

Arbitration fees and payments
</span></h3><span>
. The AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.
</span><p class="preamble_style"><span>
In addition, if the dispute is not part of the Related Cases described above, the dispute involves less than $75,000 USD, and before initiating arbitration you complied with all pre-arbitration requirements in this Section 2.14, then (1) we will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses; and (2) if, at the conclusion of the arbitration, the arbitrator awards you more than our last written offer made before the arbitrator was appointed, we will pay you (i) the amount of the award or $1,000 USD (whichever is more); and (ii) for any reasonable attorney’s fees you incurred; and any reasonable expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney accrued in connection with your individual arbitration.

Severability
</span></h3><span>
. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, a court finds any part of this Section 2.14 unenforceable as to any claim or request for a remedy, then the parties agree to arbitrate all claims and remedies subject to arbitration before litigating in court any remaining claims or remedies (such as a request for a public injunction remedy, in which case the arbitrator issues an award on liability and individual relief before a court considers that request). Otherwise, if any other part of Section 2.14 is found to be unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect (with an arbitration award issued before any court proceeding begins).

Applicable Law and Place to Resolve Disputes
</span></h2><span>
. If you acquired the Software in the United States or Canada, the laws of the state or province where you live (or, if a business, where your principal place of business is located) govern the interpretation of this agreement, claims for its breach and all other claims (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort claims), regardless of conflict of laws principles, except that the FAA governs everything related to arbitration. If you acquired the Software in any other country, its laws apply, except that the FAA governs everything related to arbitration. If US federal jurisdiction exists, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal court in King County, Washington for all disputes that are not heard in arbitration or small claims court. If not, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior Court of King County, Washington for all disputes that are not heard in arbitration or small claims court.

For example, if you acquired the Software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:

LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES
</span></h2><span>
. IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR RECOVERING DAMAGES DESPITE THE PRECEDING DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND MICROSOFT’S AFFILIATES OR SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE OR $5.00 USD, WHICHEVER IS GREATER.

</span><strong><br><span>
It also applies even if this remedy does not fully compensate you for any losses or fails of its essential purpose or if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your state, province or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
