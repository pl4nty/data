# Use Chromium snapshots

## Wait, what?

Any third-party component has to be stored in a Microsoft-internal storage
before it can be used in a Microsoft product.

Because of a complex structure of the Chromium project it is virtually impossible
to copy Chromium and all of its numerous dependencies to independent repositories.

The solution we use is to checkout Chromium with its dependencies using [gclient][]
and store all resulting files as a single piece.

## Ok, where are they?

Every snapshot is stored as a Git commit in the [electron-chromium][] repo.
Although it doesn't look like a good idea to store such big sets of files in a Git repo
this approach allows us to use gclient to manage dependencies and easily replace
a dependency on a Chromium revision with a dependency on a snapshot revision.

Snapshots are platform-dependent, so for every Chromium version several snapshots are created,
one for every platform we support. Snapshots for every platform live in their own tree inside the repo,
so there are virtually three different repos inside one.

There are no branches in the electron-chromium repo,
but every snapshot is tagged with the corresponding Chromium version and a platform identifier.

Every new snapshot is added as a child of the closest existing revision so the resulting tree is not linear.

```

                      + 68.0.3088.127
67.0.2277.122 +       │
              │       │
              │       + 68.0.3088.0
67.0.2188.42  +       │
              │       │
              └─ ─ ─ ─┼ 67.0.2188.0
                      │
                      ┴ <root>
```

## Ugh... How do I create a new snapshot then?

Use the [Build Chromium snapshot][] build definition. It creates and stores snapshots
of a Chromium version on which Electron depends.
